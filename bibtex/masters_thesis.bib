abstract = {A numeric representation of uncertain and incomplete sensor knowledge called cer- tainty grids was used successfully in sev- eral recent mobile robot control programs developed at the Carnegie-Mellon Univer- sity Mobile Robot Laboratory (MRL) Cer- tainty grids have proven to be a powerful and efficient unifying solution for sensor fusion, motion planning, landmark identi- fication, and many other central prob- lems MRL had good early success with ad hoc formulas for updating grid cells with new information. A new Bayesian statisti- cal foundation for the operations promises further improvement MRL proposes to build a software framework running on processors onboard the new Uranus mobile robot that will maintain a proba- bilistic, geometric map of the robot's sur- roundings as it moves, The certainty grid representation will allow this map to be incrementally updated in a uniform way based on information coming from vari- ous sources, including sonar, stereo vision, proximity, and contact sensors The approach can correctly model the fuzzi- ness of each reading and, at the same time, combine multiple measurements to produce sharper map features; it can also deal correctly with uncertainties in the robot's motion The map will be used by planning programs to choose clear paths, identify locations (by correlating maps), identify well-known and insufficiently sensed terrain, and perhaps identify objects by shape. The certainty grid repre- sentation can be extended in the time dimension and used to detect and track moving objects Even the simplest ver- sions of the idea allow us to fairly straightforwardly program the robot for tasks that have hitherto been out of reach MRL looks forward to a program that can explore a region and return to its starting place, using map “snapshots” from its out- bound journey to find its way back, even in the presence of disturbances of its motion and occasional changes in the terrain.},

abstract = {Three-dimensional models provide a volumetric representation of space which is important for a variety of robotic applications including flying robots and robots that are equipped with manipulators. In this paper, we present an open-source framework to generate volumetric 3D environment models. Our mapping approach is based on octrees and uses probabilistic occupancy estimation. It explicitly represents not only occupied space, but also free and unknown areas. Furthermore, we propose an octree map compression method that keeps the 3D models compact. Our framework is available as an open-source C++ library and has already been successfully applied in several robotics projects. We present a series of experimental results carried out with real robots and on publicly available real-world datasets. The results demonstrate that our approach is able to update the representation efficiently and models the data consistently while keeping the memory requirement at a minimum. ? 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract = {With the advent of new, low-cost 3D sensing hardware such as the Kinect, and continued efforts in advanced point cloud processing, 3D perception gains more and more importance in robotics, as well as other fields. In this paper we present one of our most recent initiatives in the areas of point cloud perception: PCL (Point Cloud Library - http://pointclouds.org). PCL presents an advanced and extensive approach to the subject of 3D perception, and it's meant to provide support for all the common 3D building blocks that applications need. The library contains state-of-the art algorithms for: filtering, feature estimation, surface reconstruction, registration, model fitting and segmentation. PCL is supported by an international community of robotics and perception researchers. We provide a brief walkthrough of PCL including its algorithmic capabilities and implementation strategies.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present a new hierarchical optimization solution to the graph-based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) problem. During online mapping, the approach corrects only the coarse structure of the scene and not the overall map. In this way, only updates for the parts of the map that need to be considered for making data associations are carried out. The hierarchical approach provides accurate non-linear map estimates while being highly efficient. Our error minimization approach exploits the manifold structure of the underlying space. In this way, it avoids singularities in the state space parameterization. The overall approach is accurate, efficient, designed for online operation, overcomes singularities, provides a hierarchical representation, and outperforms a series of state-of-the-art methods. ?2010 IEEE.},

@inproceedings{Cole2006,
abstract = {Traditional simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithms have been used to great effect in flat, indoor environments such as corridors and offices. We demonstrate that with a few augmentations, existing 2D SLAM technology can be extended to perform full 3D SLAM in less benign, outdoor, undulating environments. In particular, we use data acquired with a 3D laser range finder. We use a simple segmentation algorithm to separate the data stream into distinct point clouds, each referenced to a vehicle position. The SLAM technique we then adopt inherits much from 2D delayed state (or scan-matching) SLAM in that the state vector is an ever growing stack of past vehicle positions and inter-scan registrations are used to form measurements between them. The registration algorithm used is a novel combination of previous techniques carefully balancing the need for maximally wide convergence basins, robustness and speed. In addition, we introduce a novel post-registration classification technique to detect matches which have converged to incorrect local minima},

abstract = {This paper deals with the development of image occupancy grid map based on image matching by cross correlation method from laser range finder (LRF) data and goes on to develop an algorithm for robust pose estimation of a mobile robot in the static environment. Scan represents, here, a set of range measurements of the features transformed into a binary image in the environment provided by a laser range finder (LRF). By comparing a scan taken at the current pose of the robot with an existing scan, an estimate of the absolute pose of the robot is obtained. Real world experiments with a robot within a confined environment show that the pose error is small enough to allow performance of navigation tasks.},

abstract = {This paper presents the extension and experimental validation of the widely used EKF-based SLAM algorithm to 3D space. It uses planar features extracted probabilistically from dense three-dimensional point clouds generated by a rotating 2D laser scanner. These features are represented in compliance with the symmetries and perturbation model (SPmodel) in a stochastic map. As the robot moves, this map is updated incrementally while its pose is tracked by using an extended Kalman filter. After showing how three-dimensional data can be generated, the probabilistic feature extraction method is described, capable of robustly extracting (infinite) planes from structured environments. The SLAM algorithm is then used to track a robot moving through an indoor environment and its capabilities in terms of 3D reconstruction are analyzed.},

abstract = {A globally consistent solution to the simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) problem in 2D with three degrees of freedom (DoF) poses was presented by Lu and Milios [F. Lu, E. Milios, Globally consistent range scan alignment for environment mapping, Autonomous Robots 4 (April) (1997) 333-349]. To create maps suitable for natural environments it is however necessary to consider the 6DoF pose case, namely the three Cartesian coordinates and the roll, pitch and yaw angles. This article describes the extension of the proposed algorithm to deal with these additional DoFs and the resulting non-linearities. Simplifications using Taylor expansion and Cholesky decomposition yield a fast application that handles the massive amount of 3D data and the computational requirements due to the 6DoF. Our experiments demonstrate the functionality of estimating the exact poses and their covariances in all 6DoF, leading to a globally consistent map. The correspondences between scans are found automatically by use of a simple distance heuristic. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Our approach employs the EM algorithm to solve the concurrent mapping and localization problem. To accommodate the spatial nature of range data, it relies on a two-layered representa- tion of maps, where global maps are composed from a collection of small, local maps. To avoid local minima during likelihood maximization, a softmax version of theMstep is proposed that is gradually annealed to the exact maximum. Ex- perimental results demonstrate that our approach is well suited for constructing large maps of typi- cal indoor environments using sensors as inaccu- rate as sonars. 1},
