abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016. Journal of Aerospace Technology and Management. all right reserved.Birds are known for their agility, manoeuvrability, and flexibility during flight. These features allow their ability to fly under a large range of flight conditions. Bio flyers and bio aerodynamic/fluid surfaces have inspired many to perform experiments and simulations as well as to relate their results to engineering applications. Wings specifically have been the most inspirational element. Aerodynamic forces, structure, unsteady flow, fluid-structure interaction, flow control, flow adaptive elements and mechanisms, flow vortices, flapping mechanisms, and hovering flight of birds are examples of research interests. This paper presents an overview of prior analyses and experiments on the aerodynamic performance and mechanical properties of birds in steady non-flapping flight.},

abstract = {Mosquitoes exhibit unusual wing kinematics; their long, slender wings flap at remarkably high frequencies for their size ({\textgreater}800 Hz)and with lower stroke amplitudes than any other insect group. This shifts weight support away from the translation-dominated, aerodynamic mechanisms used by most insects, as well as by helicopters and aeroplanes, towards poorly understood rotational mechanisms that occur when pitching at the end of each half-stroke. Here we report free-flight mosquito wing kinematics, solve the full Navier-Stokes equations using computational fluid dynamics with overset grids, and validate our results with in vivo flow measurements. We show that, although mosquitoes use familiar separated flow patterns, much of the aerodynamic force that supports their weight is generated in a manner unlike any previously described for a flying animal. There are three key features: leading-edge vortices (a well-known mechanism that appears to be almost ubiquitous in insect flight), trailing-edge vortices caused by a form of wake capture at stroke reversal, and rotational drag. The two new elements are largely independent of the wing velocity, instead relying on rapid changes in the pitch angle (wing rotation) at the end of each half-stroke, and they are therefore relatively immune to the shallow flapping amplitude. Moreover, these mechanisms are particularly well suited to high aspect ratio mosquito wings.},

abstract = {More than a million insects and approximately 11,000 vertebrates utilize flapping wings to fly. However, flapping flight has only been studied in a few of these species, so many challenges remain in understanding this form of locomotion. Five key aerodynamic mechanisms have been identified for insect flight. Among these is the leading edge vortex, which is a convergent solution to avoid stall for insects, bats and birds. The roles of the other mechanisms - added mass, clap and fling, rotational circulation and wing-wake interactions - have not yet been thoroughly studied in the context of vertebrate flight. Further challenges to understanding bat and bird flight are posed by the complex, dynamic wing morphologies of these species and the more turbulent airflow generated by their wings compared with that observed during insect flight. Nevertheless, three dimensionless numbers that combine key flow, morphological and kinematic parameters - the Reynolds number, Rossby number and advance ratio - govern flapping wing aerodynamics for both insects and vertebrates. These numbers can thus be used to organize an integrative framework for studying and comparing animal flapping flight. Here, we provide a roadmap for developing such a framework, highlighting the aerodynamic mechanisms that remain to be quantified and compared across species. Ultimately, incorporating complex flight maneuvers, environmental effects and developmental stages into this framework will also be essential to advancing our understanding of the biomechanics, movement ecology and evolution of animal flight.},

abstract = {Competing hypotheses about evolutionary origins of flight are the ‘fundamental wing-stroke' and ‘directed aerial descent' hypotheses. Support for the fundamental wing-stroke hypothesis is that extant birds use flapping of their wings to climb even before they are able to fly; there are no reported examples of incrementally increasing use of wing movements in gliding transitioning to flapping. An open question is whether locomotor styles must evolve initially for efficiency or if they might instead arrive due to efficacy. The proximal muscles of the avian wing output work and power for flight, and new research is exploring functions of the distal muscles in relation to dynamic changes in wing shape. It will be useful to test the relative contributions of the muscles of the forearm compared with inertial and aerodynamic loading of the wing upon dynamic morphing. Body size has dramatic effects upon flight performance. New research has revealed that mass-specific muscle power declines with increasing body mass among species. This explains the constraints associated with being large. Hummingbirds are the only species that can sustain hovering. Their ability to generate force, work and power appears to be limited by time for activation and deactivation within their wingbeats of high frequency. Most small birds use flap-bounding flight, and this flight style may offer an energetic advantage over continuous flapping during fast flight or during flight into a headwind. The use of flap-bounding during slow flight remains enigmatic. Flap-bounding birds do not appear to be constrained to use their primary flight muscles in a fixed manner. To improve understanding of the functional significance of flap-bounding, the energetic costs and the relative use of alternative styles by a given species in nature merit study. This article is part of the themed issue ‘Moving in a moving medium: new perspectives on flight'.},

@article{Henningsson2014,
abstract = {Many flying animals use both flapping and gliding flight as part of their routine behaviour. These two kinematic patterns impose conflicting requirements on wing design for aerodynamic efficiency and, in the absence of extreme morphing, wings cannot be optimised for both flight modes. In gliding flight, the wing experiences uniform incident flow and the optimal shape is a high aspect ratio wing with an elliptical planform. In flapping flight, on the other hand, the wing tip travels faster than the root, creating a spanwise velocity gradient. To compensate, the optimal wing shape should taper towards the tip (reducing the local chord) and/or twist from root to tip (reducing local angle of attack). We hypothesised that, if a bird is limited in its ability to morph its wings and adapt its wing shape to suit both flight modes, then a preference towards flapping flight optimization will be expected since this is the most energetically demanding flight mode. We tested this by studying a well-known flap-gliding species, the common swift, by measuring the wakes generated by two birds, one in gliding and one in flapping flight in a wind tunnel. We calculated span efficiency, the efficiency of lift production, and found that the flapping swift had consistently higher span efficiency than the gliding swift. This supports our hypothesis and suggests that even though swifts have been shown previously to increase their lift-to-drag ratio substantially when gliding, the wing morphology is tuned to be more aerodynamically efficient in generating lift during flapping. Since body drag can be assumed to be similar for both flapping and gliding, it follows that the higher total drag in flapping flight compared with gliding flight is primarily a consequence of an increase in wing profile drag due to the flapping motion, exceeding the reduction in induced drag.},

abstract = {The alula is a small structure located at the joint between the hand-wing and arm-wing of birds and is known to be used in slow flight with high angles of attack such as landing. It is assumed to function similarly to a leading-edge slat that increases lift and delays stall. However, in spite of its universal presence in flying birds and the wide acceptance of stall delay as its main function, how the alula delays the stall and aids the flight of birds remains unclear. Here, we investigated the function of alula on the aerodynamic performance of avian wings based on data from flight tasks and wind-tunnel experiments. With the alula, the birds performed steeper descending flights with greater changes in body orientation. Force measurements revealed that the alula increases the lift and often delays the stall. Digital particle image velocimetry showed that these effects are caused by the streamwise vortex, formed at the tip of the alula, that induces strong downwash and suppresses the flow separation over the wing surface. This is the first experimental evidence that the alula functions as a vortex generator that increases the lift force and enhances manoeuvrability in flights at high angles of attack.},

In this article, we evaluate vision algorithms as alternatives for detection and distance estimation of mUAVs, since other sensing modalities entail certain limitations on the environment or on the distance. For this purpose, we test Haar-like features, histogram of gradients (HOG) and local binary patterns (LBP) using cascades of boosted classifiers. Cascaded boosted classifiers allow fast processing by performing detection tests at multiple stages, where only candidates passing earlier simple stages are processed at the preceding more complex stages. We also integrate a distance estimation method with our system utilizing geometric cues with support vector regressors. We evaluated each method on indoor and outdoor videos that are collected in a systematic way and also on videos having motion blur. Our experiments show that, using boosted cascaded classifiers with LBP, near real-time detection and distance estimation of mUAVs are possible in about 60 ms indoors (1032 × 778 resolution) and 150 ms outdoors (1280 × 720 resolution) per frame, with a detection rate of 0.96 F-score. However, the cascaded classifiers using Haar-like features lead to better distance estimation since they can position the bounding boxes on mUAVs more accurately. On the other hand, our time analysis yields that the cascaded classifiers using HOG train and run faster than the other algorithms.},

abstract = {In this work, how a small bird (Japanese White-eye, Zosterops japonicus) executes a sharp turning maneuver is analyzed from a mechanical perspective. A specific type of turning maneuver, termed a 'hovering turn', was experimentally identified, which is evidently distinct from the yaw or bank turn that is well documented in the literature. The hovering turn is characterized by a turning radius only about {\~{}}1/10 of the wingspan, and requires less than 0. 2 s. The reorientation of the bird's body is invariably preceded by a brief hovering stage during which the elevation angle of the bird increases from 40° to approximately 90°, leading beneficially to a considerable decrease (40{\%} of its maximum) in the moment of inertia of the body against the axis of rotation. The brief hovering is deemed a strategic, preparatory and transitional stage in executing a roll-dominated turn that is efficient and particularly suitable for a small space. The mechanisms pertaining to the hovering turn might provide a useful, biomechanical inspiration to improve the maneuverability of artificial aerial vehicles. {\textcopyright} 2011 Society for Experimental Mechanics.},

All image analysis and processing necessary for deriving and controlling the flight trajectory take place off-board on a system external to the MAV. This permits the use of sophisticated multithreaded real-time algorithms that do not limit the speed of the drone. Furthermore, due to the elimination of on-board processing and possibly the use of additional sensors for realizing such autonomy, stock drones can be used and flight times realized on a single charge remain unaffected.

abstract = {We investigate the kinematic feasibility of a tendon-based flexible parallel platform actuator. Much of the research on tendon-driven Stewart platforms is devoted either to the completely restrained positioning mechanism (CRPM) or to one particular type of the incompletely restrained positioning mechanism (IRPM) where the external force is provided by the gravitational pull on the platform such as in cable-suspended Stewart platforms. An IRPM-based platform is proposed which uses the external force provided by a compliant member. The compliant central column allows the configuration to achieve n DOFs with n tendons. In particular, this investigation focuses on the angular deflection of the upper platform with respect to the lower platform. The application here is aimed at developing a linkable module that can be connected to one another so as to form a "snake robot" of sorts. Since locomotion takes precedence over positioning in this application, a 3-DOF Stewart platform is adopted. For an arbitrary angular displace of the end-effector, the corresponding length of each tendon can be determined through inverse kinematics. Mathematical singularities are investigated using the traditional analytical method of defining the Jacobian. {\&}copy; 2015 Md. Masum Billah and Raisuddin Khan.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016. Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd.Birds morph their wings during a single wingbeat, across flight speeds and among flight modes. Such morphing may allow them to maximize aerodynamic performance, but this assumption remains largely untested. We tested the aerodynamic performance of swept and extended wing postures of 13 raptor species in three families (Accipitridae, Falconidae and Strigidae) using a propeller model to emulate mid-downstroke of flapping during take-off and a wind tunnel to emulate gliding. Based on previous research, we hypothesized that (1) during flapping, wing posture would not affect maximum ratios of vertical and horizontal force coefficients (CV:CH), and that (2) extended wings would have higher maximum CV:CH when gliding. Contrary to each hypothesis, during flapping, extended wings had, on average, 31{\%} higher maximum CV:CHratios and 23{\%} higher CV than swept wings across all biologically relevant attack angles ($\alpha$), and, during gliding, maximum CV:CH ratios were similar for the two postures. Swept wings had 11{\%} higher CV than extended wings in gliding flight, suggesting flow conditions around these flexed raptor wings may be different from those in previous studies of swifts (Apodidae). Phylogenetic affiliation was a poor predictor of wing performance, due in part to high intrafamilial variation. Mass was only significantly correlated with extended wing performance during gliding. We conclude that wing shape has a greater effect on force per unit wing area during flapping at low advance ratio, such as takeoff, than during gliding.},

abstract = {Swifts are among the most aerodynamically refined gliding birds. However, the overlapping vanes and protruding shafts of their primary feathers make swift wings remarkably rough for their size. Wing roughness height is 1-2{\%} of chord length on the upper surface-10,000 times rougher than sailplane wings. Sailplanes depend on extreme wing smoothness to increase the area of laminar flow on the wing surface and minimize drag for extended glides. To understand why the swift does not rely on smooth wings, we used a stethoscope to map laminar flow over preserved wings in a low-turbulence wind tunnel. By combining laminar area, lift, and drag measurements, we show that average area of laminar flow on swift wings is 69{\%} (n = 3; std 13{\%}) of their total area during glides that maximize flight distance and duration-similar to high-performance sailplanes. Our aerodynamic analysis indicates that swifts attain laminar flow over their rough wings because their wing size is comparable to the distance the air travels (after a roughness-induced perturbation) before it transitions from laminar to turbulent. To interpret the function of swift wing roughness, we simulated its effect on smooth model wings using physical models. This manipulation shows that laminar flow is reduced and drag increased at high speeds. At the speeds at which swifts cruise, however, swift-like roughness prolongs laminar flow and reduces drag. This feature gives small birds with rudimentary wings an edge during the evolution of glide performance.},

abstract = {Inspired by birds flying through cluttered environments such as dense forests, this paper studies the theoretical foundations of a novel motion planning problem: high-speed navigation through a randomly-generated obstacle field when only the statistics of the obstacle generating process are known a priori. Resembling a planar forest environment, the obstacle generating process is assumed to determine the locations and sizes of disk-shaped obstacles. When this process is ergodic, and under mild technical conditions on the dynamics of the bird, it is shown that the existence of an infinite collision-free trajectory through the forest exhibits a phase transition. On one hand, if the bird flies faster than a certain critical speed, then, with probability one, there is no infinite collision-free trajectory, i.e., the bird will eventually collide with some tree, almost surely, regardless of the planning algorithm governing the bird's motion. On the other hand, if the bird flies slower than this critical speed, then there exists at least one infinite collision-free trajectory, almost surely. Lower and upper bounds on the critical speed are derived for the special case of a homogeneous Poisson forest considering a simple model for the bird's dynamics. For the same case, an equivalent percolation model is provided. Using this model, the phase diagram is approximated in Monte-Carlo simulations. This paper also establishes novel connections between robot motion planning and statistical physics through ergodic theory and percolation theory, which may be of independent interest.},

A unique feature of this robot is that it uses wing articulation to control the flight path angle as well as the heading angle. It lacks a vertical tail for improved agility, which results in unstable lateral-directional dynamics. New closed-loop motion planning algorithms with guaranteed stability are obtained by rewriting the flight dynamic equations in the spatial domain rather than as functions of time, after which dynamic inversion is employed. It is shown that nonlinear dynamic inversion naturally leads to proportional-integral-derivative controllers, thereby providing an exact method for tuning the gains. The capabilities of the proposed bioinspired robot design and its novel closed-loop perching controller have been successfully demonstrated with perched landings on a human hand.},

The current sensor pose is simultaneously obtained by tracking the live depth frame relative to the global model using a coarse-to-fine iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm, which uses all of the observed depth data available. We demonstrate the advantages of tracking against the growing full surface model compared with frame-to-frame tracking, obtaining tracking and mapping results in constant time within room sized scenes with limited drift and high accuracy.

abstract = {Gliding flight performance and wake topology of a common swift (Apus apus L.) were examined in a wind tunnel at speeds between 7 and 11 m s(-1). The tunnel was tilted to simulate descending flight at different sink speeds. The swift varied its wingspan, wing area and tail span over the speed range. Wingspan decreased linearly with speed, whereas tail span decreased in a nonlinear manner. For each airspeed, the minimum glide angle was found. The corresponding sink speeds showed a curvilinear relationship with airspeed, with a minimum sink speed at 8.1 m s(-1) and a speed of best glide at 9.4 m s(-1). Lift-to-drag ratio was calculated for each airspeed and tilt angle combinations and the maximum for each speed showed a curvilinear relationship with airspeed, with a maximum of 12.5 at an airspeed of 9.5 m s(-1). Wake was sampled in the transverse plane using stereo digital particle image velocimetry (DPIV). The main structures of the wake were a pair of trailing wingtip vortices and a pair of trailing tail vortices. Circulation of these was measured and a model was constructed that showed good weight support. Parasite drag was estimated from the wake defect measured in the wake behind the body. Parasite drag coefficient ranged from 0.30 to 0.22 over the range of airspeeds. Induced drag was calculated and used to estimate profile drag coefficient, which was found to be in the same range as that previously measured on a Harris' hawk.},

In this study reduced order models are obtained using an improved method, the eigensystem realization algorithm (ERA), which is more ecient to compute and ts within a standard control design framework. For test cases involving pitching and plunging motions, it is shown that Wagner's indicial response is closely approximated by ERA models of orders 4 and 6, respectively.

abstract = {We present a new mechanism for passive wing morphing of flapping wings inspired by bat and bird wing morphology. The mechanism consists of an unactuated hand wing connected to the arm wing with a wrist joint. Flapping motion generates centrifugal accelerations in the hand wing, forcing it to unfold passively. Using a robotic model in hover, we made kinematic measurements of unfolding kinematics as functions of the non-dimensional wingspan fold ratio (2–2.5) and flapping frequency (5–17 Hz) using stereo high-speed cameras. We find that the wings unfold passively within one to two flaps and remain unfolded with only small amplitude oscillations. To better understand the passive dynamics, we constructed a computer model of the unfolding process based on rigid body dynamics, contact models, and aerodynamic correlations. This model predicts the measured passive unfolding within about one flap and shows that unfolding is driven by centrifugal acceleration induced by flapping. The simulations also predict that relative unfolding time only weakly depends on flapping frequency and can be reduced to less than half a wingbeat by increasing flapping amplitude. Subsequent dimensional analysis shows that the time required to unfold passively is of the same order of magnitude as the flapping period. This suggests that centrifugal acceleration can drive passive unfolding within approximately one wingbeat in small and large wings. Finally, we show experimentally that passive unfolding wings can withstand impact with a branch, by first folding and then unfolding passively. This mechanism enables flapping robots to squeeze through clutter without sophisticated control. Passive unfolding also provides a new avenue in morphing wing design that makes future flapping morphing wings possibly more energy efficient and light-weight. Simultaneously these results point to possible inertia driven, and therefore metabolically efficient, control strategies in bats and birds to morph or recover within a beat.},

abstract = {An investigation with computational fluid dynamics of the ground effect on a small bird revealed quantitatively the obstruction of the vortex expansion resulting from the presence of the ground at varied distance. Preceding authors focused mainly on the bird's wings, generally neglecting the bird's body; we discuss specifically the distinction of the aerodynamic effect between cases with and without the presence of the bird's body. The results of simulation show that, considering only two wings, for a distance between the wing model and the ground smaller than a semi-span, the smaller is the ground clearance, the more significant is the ground effect. At clearance 0.37 times a semi-span, the drag is decreased 11{\%}, and the lift is increased 5.6{\%}. The ground effect for an intact bird model composed of both wings and body is less effective than that for a simplified model with body omitted, because a suction was observed on the lower surface of the intact bird's trunk at clearance 0.37 times a semi-span; for this reason the intact bird model benefits less from the ground effect than the model with body excluded, but increased lift and decreased drag remain observable.

Models are obtained at various angles of attack and they are verified against measurements using frequency response plots and large-amplitude manoeuvres. These models provide a low-dimensional balanced representation of the relevant unsteady fluid dynamics. In simulations, flow structures are visualized using finite-time Lyapunov exponents. A number of phenomenological trends are observed, both in the data and in the models. As the base angle of attack increases, the boundary layer begins to separate, resulting in a decreased quasi-steady lift coefficient slope and a delayed relaxation to steady state at low frequencies. This extends the low-frequency range of motions that excite unsteady effects, meaning that the quasi-steady approximation is not valid until lower frequencies than are predicted by Theodorsen's classical inviscid model. In addition, at small angles of attack, the lift coefficient rises to the steady-state value after a step in angle, while at larger angles of attack, the lift coefficient relaxes down to the steady-state after an initially high lift state. Flow visualization indicates that this coincides with the formation and convection of vortices at the leading edge and trailing edge. As the angle of attack approaches the critical angle for vortex shedding, the poles and zeros of the model approach the imaginary axis in the complex plane, and some zeros cross into the right half plane. This has significant implications for active flow control, which are discussed. These trends are observed in both simulations and wind-tunnel data.},

The dihedral angles can be varied symmetrically on both wings to control the aircraft speed independently of the angle of attack and flight-path angle, while an asymmetric dihedral setting can be used to control yaw in the absence of a vertical tail.Anonlinear aeroelastic model is derived, and it is used to study the steadystate performance and flight stability of the micro aerial vehicle. The concept of the effective dihedral is introduced, which allows for a unified treatment of rigid and flexible wing aircraft. It also identifies the amount of elasticity that is necessary to obtain tangible performance benefits over a rigid wing. The feasibility of using axial tension to stiffen the wing is discussed, and, at least in the context of a linear model, it is shown that adding axial tension is effective but undesirable. The turning performance of an micro aerial vehicle with flexible wings is compared to an otherwise identical micro aerial vehicle with rigid wings. The wing dihedral alone can be varied asymmetrically to perform rapid turns and regulate sideslip. The maximum attainable turn rate for a given elevator setting, however, does not increase unless antisymmetric wing twisting is employed. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2011.},

abstract = {How predators search for prey is a cornerstone question in behavioural ecology, which has yet to be investigated for animals foraging in 3D airspace. Do insectivorous birds such as swifts (Apodidae), swallows and martins (Hirundinidae) use similar strategies to those performed by terrestrial predators in 2D, or do they rely on different spatial search strategies because of some properties of the aerial open space? We addressed this question in the common swift, one of the most aerial birds, using a novel 3D optical tracking method. The analysis of fine-scale flight tracks revealed how birds distribute their presence in 3D space while foraging near their breeding colony. Common swifts concentrated the time spent per volume unit by adopting a tortuous path, and, to a much lesser extent, by decreasing their movement speed. By independently observing the birds' posture on tracking images, we were able to identify the occurrence of putative prey captures along flight tracks. We show that swifts' presence was concentrated mainly in the vicinity of prey captures, unveiling a volume-concentrated search (VCS) strategy in this aerial insectivore. This is an extension in 3D of the area-concentrated search classically described in terrestrial 2D space. VCS can (but does not necessarily) take place in thermal updrafts, where small insects can be concentrated in patches. In contrast to terrestrial and aquatic predators that can easily slow down or stop their movement in profitable places, a different speed–cost relationship underlying aerial movement prevents swifts from stopping in prey patches and explains why these birds rely mainly on movement tortuosity to perform intensive search. Our study thus shows how some physical properties of the environment can modulate the way an animal concentrates its search in profitable places.},

We here proffer an analysis based on kinematic theory and experimental visualization of the flow to complete a treatment of the aerodynamic force affecting a hovering flyer that generates a lift force approximately equal to its weight, and remains nearly stationary in midair; the center and direction of the aerodynamic force are accordingly determined with some assumptions made. The principal condition to resolve the problem is the stabilization of the vision of a flyer, which is inspired by a hovering passerine that experiences a substantial upward swing during downstroke periods while its eye remains stabilized. Viewing the aerodynamic force with a bird's eye, we find that the center and direction of this aerodynamic force vary continuously with respect to the lift force. Our results provide practical guidance for engineers to enhance the visual stability of surveillance cameras incorporated in micro aerial vehicles.},

abstract = {Gliding birds continually change the shape and size of their wings, presumably to exploit the profound effect of wing morphology on aerodynamic performance. That birds should adjust wing sweep to suit glide speed has been predicted qualitatively by analytical glide models, which extrapolated the wing's performance envelope from aerodynamic theory. Here we describe the aerodynamic and structural performance of actual swift wings, as measured in a wind tunnel, and on this basis build a semi-empirical glide model. By measuring inside and outside swifts' behavioural envelope, we show that choosing the most suitable sweep can halve sink speed or triple turning rate. Extended wings are superior for slow glides and turns; swept wings are superior for fast glides and turns. This superiority is due to better aerodynamic performance-with the exception of fast turns. Swept wings are less effective at generating lift while turning at high speeds, but can bear the extreme loads. Finally, our glide model predicts that cost-effective gliding occurs at speeds of 8-10 m s(-1), whereas agility-related figures of merit peak at 15-25 m s(-1). In fact, swifts spend the night ('roost') in flight at 8-10 m s(-1) (ref. 11), thus our model can explain this choice for a resting behaviour. Morphing not only adjusts birds' wing performance to the task at hand, but could also control the flight of future aircraft.},
