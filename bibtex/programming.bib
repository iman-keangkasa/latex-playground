abstract = {Investigators have modeled oceanic and atmospheric vortices in the laboratory in a number of different ways, employing background rotation, density effects, and geometrical confinement. In this article, we address barotropic vortices in a rotating fluid, emphasizing generation techniques, instability issues, and topography effects in particular.We then review work on vortices in shallow fluid layers, including topography effects on vortices in coastal areas and the role of vortices in tidal exchange between two connected basins.},
