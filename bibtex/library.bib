abstract = {The recent development of various methods of modulation such as PCM and PPM which exchange bandwidth for signal-to-noise ratio has intensified the interest in a general theory of communication. A basis for such a theory is contained in the important papers of Nyquist and Hartley on this subject. In the present paper we will extend the theory to include a number of new factors, in particular the effect of noise in the channel, and the savings possible due to the statistical structure of the original message and due to the nature of the final destination of the information. The fundamental problem of communication is that of reproducing at one point either exactly or approximately a message selected at another point. Frequently the messages have meaning; that is they refer to or are correlated according to some system with certain physical or conceptual entities. These semantic aspects of communication are irrelevant to the engineering problem. The significant aspect is that the actual message is one selected from a set of possible messages. The system must be designed to operate for each possible selection, not just the one which will actually be chosen since this is unknown at the time of design. If the number of messages in the set is finite then this number or any monotonic function of this number can be regarded as a measure of the information produced when one message is chosen from the set, all choices being equally likely. As was pointed out by Hartley the most natural choice is the logarithmic function. Although this definition must be generalized considerably when we consider the influence of the statistics of the message and when we have a continuous range of messages, we will in all cases use an essentially logarithmic measure.},

abstract = {We propose a direct (feature-less) monocular SLAM algorithm which, in contrast to current state-of-the-art regarding direct meth- ods, allows to build large-scale, consistent maps of the environment. Along with highly accurate pose estimation based on direct image alignment, the 3D environment is reconstructed in real-time as pose-graph of keyframes with associated semi-dense depth maps. These are obtained by filtering over a large number of pixelwise small-baseline stereo comparisons. The explicitly scale-drift aware formulation allows the approach to operate on challenging sequences including large variations in scene scale. Major enablers are two key novelties: (1) a novel direct tracking method which operates on sim(3), thereby explicitly detecting scale-drift, and (2) an elegant probabilistic solution to include the effect of noisy depth values into tracking. The resulting direct monocular SLAM system runs in real-time on a CPU.},

This paper address a novel approach to the Next best veiw (NBV) problem: to find a location in space for a manipulator to achieve the highest information gain. The author uses Probabilistic Roadmap for their motion planning approach. The estimate a pose by predicting multiple position in the manipulator's workspace and calculate the information gain from each position; they call this stage as the virtual scanning. 

They use occupancy grid map as their initial estimation of the workspace model. This model is accounted because of noise of the Kinect sensor used in their work. However the paper are more interested in the uncertainty management of the unknown space where the point could from the Kinect are not detected at a certain region in the workspace.

They have only run simulation of their method based on PR2 robot platform.},

abstract = {This study attempts to present a new and comprehensive cycle for the design of fixed wing micro air vehicles. The idea is to propose a complete cycle containing all micro air vehicles design subjects such as aerodynamics, stability, structure, and navigation. The main aim of the cycle is to decrease the designing time for an optimum design. In this method, the sizing process is started simultaneously, which involves the following cases: specification of mission and aviation plan; determination of planform and aspect ratio; constraint analysis; estimation of plane weight. Completion of these four phases results in the specification of the geometry and dimensions of the wing in an optimum manner. After determination of the planform geometry, selection of the airfoil is carried out by complying with the defined criteria. After this stage, the wing of micro air vehicle is designed completely and analysis is carried out to determine the aerodynamics coefficients. Next step is designing the fuselage for the airplane. Then micro air vehicle and aerodynamic center of wing are calculated and stability equations for micro air vehicle are simulated. The results of these processes are determination of surfaces, dimensions and airfoils of the tails and center of gravity of the plane. After calculation of the control surfaces, the designed micro air vehicle is analyzed in XFLR5 software. Next step is selection of electric equipment such as motor, batteries, servo, etc. The final step of design is the optimization of the micro air vehicle for increasing its performance and endurance. After the design, steps of manufacturing will be started.$\backslash$r$\backslash$n},

abstract = {This paper utilizes a human-robot interface system which incorporates particle filter (PF) and adaptive multispace transformation (AMT) to track the pose of the human hand for controlling the robot manipulator. This system employs a 3D camera (Kinect) to determine the orientation and the translation of the human hand. We use Camshift algorithm to track the hand. PF is used to estimate the translation of the human hand. Although a PF is used for estimating the translation, the translation error increases in a short period of time when the sensors fail to detect the hand motion. Therefore, a methodology to correct the translation error is required. What is more, to be subject to the perceptive limitations and the motor limitations, human operator is hard to carry out the high precision operation. This paper proposes an adaptive multispace transformation (AMT) method to assist the operator to improve the accuracy and reliability in determining the pose of the robot. The human-robot interface system was experimentally tested in a lab environment, and the results indicate that such a system can successfully control a robot manipulator.},

Their result has no benchmark but they report the success of the manipulator to replicate the motion of the demonstrator

Their approach however, uses occupancy grid map to represent the workspace of the robot. The occupancy grid map act as an uncertainty management part of their teaching by demonstration method to improve the movement of the robot when sonar sensors are used. A sonar sensor gives out noise ridden measurements. This improvement entails the understanding of free space and the feasibility to repeat a learn motion in an this free space that may change in the future under the use of noisy sensor measurement. By using occupancy grid map. To map the movement of the demonstrator into the robot configuration space, they use a pseudo inverted Jacobian matrix which reduce the higher degree of freedom of the demonstrator to an appropriate degree of freedom of the manipulator.},

Accordingly it requires a model of the future evolution of the environment. In the real-world, the future trajectories of the obstacles are generally unknown and only estimates are available.

abstract = {Depression is a commonly occurring mental disorder, which is characterized by dysfunctional inhibition and facilitation for emotional stimuli. The aim of the present study was to investigate distracter inhibition and facilitation for emotional faces in depressed individuals in a negative affective priming task. Control participants who had never suffered from depression (NC), sub-clinically depressed participants, and participants diagnosed with a current major depressive disorder (MDD), Anxiety Inventory, the Hamilton Depression Rating Score were recruited using the Beck Depression Inventory, the Beck and DSM-IV as tools. Twenty-four participants in each group completed a negative affective priming task. The main finding was that there were no significant differences among the three groups in the positive and negative priming effects of happy faces. However, there were significant differences for positive and negative priming effects of sad faces between each pair of groups, with the effects being lowest for MDD and highest for NC participants. It can be concluded that depressed individuals are characterized by enhanced facilitation and deficient inhibition for negative materials, which is a stable cognitive vulnerability risk, possibly associated with the occurrence of depression. There are differences in the cognitive dysfunction for negative stimuli between clinically depressed and sub-clinically depressed individuals. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

It starts by finding a suboptimal solution quickly using a loose bound, then tightens the bound progressively as time allows. Given enough time it finds a provably optimal solution. While improving its bound, ARA* reuses previous search efforts and, as a result, is significantly more efficient than other anytime search methods.

The results obtained in a typical working space of a robot cell of about 4.5m {\&}times; 4.5m are in the range of 15mm to 35mm compared to ground truth provided by a laser tracker.

abstract = {$\backslash$nIn recent years, object detection has become an increasingly active field of research in robotics. An important problem in object detection is the availability of a sufficient amount of labeled training data to learn good classifiers. In this paper we show how to significantly reduce the need for manually labeled training data by leveraging data sets available on the World Wide Web. Specifically, we show how to use objects from Google's 3D Warehouse to train an object detection system for 3D point clouds collected by robots navigating through both urban and indoor environments. In order to deal with the different characteristics of the web data and the real robot data, we additionally use a small set of labeled point clouds and perform domain adaptation. Our experiments demonstrate that additional data taken from the 3D Warehouse along with our domain adaptation greatly improves the classification accuracy on real-world environments.$\backslash$n},

abstract = {Maximizing the tracking performance of an industrial manipulator requires an accurate expression of manipulator dynamics and efficient model parameterization. These objectives are difficult to achieve in manipulators with flexible joints since link positions typically are not measured. We present in this paper an extended Kalman filter (EKF) observer to estimate manipulator states and couple these estimates to an adaptive rigid-link flexible-joint (RLFJ) controller. In a computer simulation, the EKF-RLFJ controller demonstrated superior tracking performance compared to a traditional adaptive controller. Experimental results for the Mitsubishi PA10-6CE showed improvements in tracking performance using the EKF-RLFJ controller with a 5 kg end-effector payload. Even greater improvements in tracking performance may be achieved in manipulators with significant joint flexibility.},
annote = {This paper attempts to estimate the position of rigid links and flexible joint (RLFJ) manipulator using discrete-time extended Kalman Filter as an observer for the robot model and control system. 

The uncertainties of the link and the motors' dynamics are modeled into the manipulator's dynamic equations. The position of the links are nonlinear because of the flexibility of the manipulator's joints.

The authors stress that EKF has non-optimal estimation as is the case of any algorithm that requires linearization. They performed a simulation and reiterate their models and algorithm on a Mitsubishi PA10-6CE manipulator experimentally. They observed improved tracking performance for highly flexible joints (joints under high torque) and low tracking performance for rigid joints. Thus, the authors introduce a mixed rigid-joint/flexible joint model to the EKF-RLFL controller which improved the overall tracking performance.

This observation is also seen in Haghighipanal et al. (2016)},

Since the researcher maintain a constant velocity to the object, the tracking can use a Kalman filtering technique without linearization. However, since the tracking of the object requires the movement of the camera, given the nonlinearity of an inverse kinematic solution of their robot system, the use of extended Kalman filter is justified.

abstract = {Inverse Kinematics (IK) is defined as the problem of determining a set of appropriate joint configurations for which the end effectors move to desired positions as smoothly, rapidly, and as accurately as possible. During the last decades, several methods and techniques, sophisticated or heuristic, have been presented to produce fast and realistic solutions to the IK problem. However, most of the currently available methods suffer from high computational cost and production of unrealistic poses. This report reviews and compares the most popular IK meth- ods regarding reliability, computational cost and conversion criteria, with a novel heuristic and iterative method, called Forward And Backward Reaching Inverse Kinematics (FABRIK). FABRIK avoids the use of rotational angles or matrices, and instead finds each joint position via locating a point on a line. Thus, it converges in fewer iterations, has low computational cost and produces realistic poses. Constraints can easily be incorporated within the FABRIK methodology and multiple chains with multiple end effectors are also easily supported.},

abstract = {In the last years several direct (i.e. featureless) monocular SLAM approaches have appeared showing impressive semi-dense or dense scene reconstructions. These works have questioned the need of features, in which consolidated SLAM techniques of the last decade were based. In this paper we present a novel feature-based monocular SLAM system that is more robust, gives more accurate camera poses, and obtains comparable or better semi-dense reconstructions than the current state of the art. Our semi-dense mapping operates over keyframes, optimized by local bundle adjustment, allowing to obtain accurate triangulations from wide baselines. Our novel method to search correspondences, the measurement fusion and the inter-keyframe depth consistency tests allow to obtain clean reconstructions with very few outliers. Against the current trend in direct SLAM, our experiments show that by decoupling the semi-dense reconstruction from the trajectory computation, the results obtained are better. This opens the discussion on the benefits of features even if a semi-dense reconstruction is desired.},

abstract = {This paper presents a mobile manipulation and visual servoing design for a configurable mobile manipulator by using a Kinect sensor. To achieve this goal, an image-based grasping design is combined with a visual simultaneous localization and mapping (vSLAM). The proposed vSLAM method is based on extended Kalman filter (EKF) and a Kinect RGBD sensor. In the manipulator design, the robot arms are designed to be able to configure as a handrail for user support in execution of walking assistance tasks. The purpose of this design is to perform mobile manipulation and walking assistance tasks on the same robot. Experiments on the prototype dual-arm mobile manipulator validate that the proposed method can find and grasp a target object after navigation a distance to the object position. After the robot delivered the object to the user, it configured to provide walking assist to the user using the suggested compliance controller.},

We will only regard the grasping problem since it directly involve manipulation under uncertainty.

During object identification, the authors raised the concern of matching error during identification which may result in misleading object recognition. They mitigate the problem using random sample consensus algorithm (RANSAC) to reject outliers adn to find the homography matrix. Homography matrix transforms points in one image to the corresponding points in another image when a camera changes in position.

The result of their investigation suggest a successful object retriaval to a person. They did not, however, present any comparison of their result with other approach for the Grasping problem.},

abstract = {Decision making on alternatives for risk reduction planning starts with an intelligence phase for recognition of the decision problems and identifying the objectives. Development of the alternatives and assigning the variable by decision makers to each alternative are employed to the design phase. The final phase evaluates the optimal choice by comparing the alternatives, defining indicators, assigning a weight to each and ranking them [4]. This process is referred to as Multi‐Criteria Decision Making analysis (MCDM), Multi‐Criteria Evaluation (MCE) or Multi‐Criteria Analysis (MCA). MCDM is performed by choice and prioritization and is defined based on Alternative, Value, Criteria and the Weights on the Criteria. MCDM can be classified as Multi Objective Decision Making (MODM) and Multi Attribute Decision Making (MADM). Sometimes it can be referred to as Single or Group decision making and be based on these methods, and it can be achieved by certainty or uncertainty [1]. Malczewski [2] stated that the most projects using MCDM are based on single decision making. Nevertheless, group decision will give us benefits in the SDSS. It depends if each group has different choices of decisions [3]. The MCDM module is implemented for Multi‐Criteria Decision Making analysis (MCDM) incorporating monetary and non‐ monetary criteria in the analysis for the optimal alternative. The MCDM module consists of several components. The first step is to define criteria (or Indicators) which are subdivided into disadvantages (criteria that indicate the difficulty for implementing the risk reduction strategy, also referred to as costs) and advantages (criteria that indicate the favourability, also referred to as benefits). In the next step the stakeholders can use the developed web‐based tool for prioritizing criteria and setting up the decision matrix MCE METHODS There are many methods available for MCDM. These methods can be divided to deterministic, fuzzy and stochastic. When there is certainty in the alternatives, we go for deterministic and if uncertainty is apparent, fuzzy and stochastic models are useful. MCDM are introduced by different methods like [1] Weighted sum Model (WSM), Weighted Product Model (WPM), Analytic hierarchy process (AHP), Revised AHP, Elimination and Choice Translating Reality (ELECTRE), TOPSIS (for the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) etc. The SDSS applies the most common and easiest way of MCDM known as WSM. In a later version of the SDSS, we might integrate TOPSIS and Fuzzy methods to the study and compare the results. The output of the Cost Benefit Analysis and the Risk Analysis will be used for the Multi‐Criteria decision making and for comparison between alternatives.},

It offers a comprehensive reference and text for Processing (www.processing.org), an open-source programming language that can be used by students, artists, designers, architects, researchers, and anyone who wants to program images, animation, and interactivity.Processing have been tested in classrooms, workshops, and arts institutions, including UCLA, Carnegie Mellon, New York University, and Harvard University. Tutorial units make up the bulk of the book and introduce the syntax and concepts of software (including variables, functions, and object-oriented programming), cover such topics as photography and drawing in relation to software, and feature many short, prototypical example programs with related images and explanations. More advanced professional projects from such domains as animation, performance, and typography are discussed in interviews with their creators. "Extensions" present concise introductions to further areas of investigation, including computer vision, sound, and electronics. Appendixes, references to other material, and a glossary contain additional technical details.

abstract = {Cable driven manipulators are popular in surgical robots due to compact design, low inertia, and remote actuation. In these manipulators, encoders are usually mounted on the motor, and joint angles are estimated based on transmission kinematics. However, due to non-linear properties of cables such as cable stretch, lower stiffness, and uncertainties in kinematic model parameters, the precision of joint angle estimation is limited with transmission kinematics approach. To improve the positioning of these manipulators, we use a pair of low cost stereo camera as the observation for joint angles and we input these noisy measurements into an Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) for state estimation. We use the dual UKF to estimate cable parameters and states offline. We evaluated the effectiveness of the proposed method on a Raven-II experimental surgical research platform. Additional encoders at the joint output were employed as a reference system. From the experiments, the UKF improved the accuracy of joint angle estimation by 33- 72{\%}. Also, we tested the reliability of state estimation under camera occlusion. We found that when the system dynamics is tuned with offline UKF parameter estimation, the camera occlusion has no effect on the online state estimation. {\&}copy; 2016 IEEE.},

abstract = {A robot with a hand-mounted depth sensor scans a scene. When the robot's joint angles are not known with certainty, how can it best reconstruct the scene? In this work, we simultaneously estimate the joint angles of the robot and reconstruct a dense volumetric model of the scene. In this way, we perform simultaneous localization and mapping in the configuration space of the robot, rather than in the pose space of the camera. We show using simulations and robot experiments that our approach greatly reduces both 3D reconstruction error and joint angle error over simply using the forward kinematics. Unlike other approaches, ours directly reasons about robot joint angles, and can use these to constrain the pose of the sensor. Because of this, it is more robust to missing or ambiguous depth data than approaches that are unconstrained by the robot's kinematics.},
annote = {The paper present a Simultaneous localization and mapping using a manipulator. Simultaneous localization and mapping involves obtaining a solution for pose estimation through map learning and vice versa simultaneously. 



The authors argue that encoders on each joints of a manipulator is not enough to estimate the end point of a manipulator due to gear trash, cable strechm non-rigid deformation and others.

The ARM-SLAM uses TSDF as part of the scene reconstruction to help estimate the pose of the end effector. TSDF is a variant of Dense Fusion 

They ARM-SLAM assume eye-in-hand configuration.

They conducted three experiments to validate their SLAM solution:
-2D simulation where they compare pose error between forward kinematics, Dense Fusion algorithm and ARM-SLAM algorithm. The result shows significant error reduction for both of the two algorithms compared to the forward kinematics calculation. ARM-SLAM, however, has the lowest errors.

-in their 3D simulation experiment, the authors compare results for forward kinematics calculation with kinect fusion and ARM-SLAM. They observed that ARM-SLAM is more robust when lost of data occurs.

-real shelf scanning experiments. In this experiment, the authors could not conclusively see better pose estimation with compared to the forward kinematics calculation. However, they reiterate that during lost of data, the ARM-SLAM solution produce robust estimation.

abstract = {Robot path planning is an important part of the development of autonomous systems. Numerous strategies have been proposed in the literature regarding mobile robots but trajectory planning for manipulators is considerably more difficult since the entire structure can move and therefore produce collisions with surrounding obstacles. This paper presents an original solution and analytical comparison to path planning for manipulator arms. Path planning is executed in two parts: first, a global path is found to guide the end-effector in the environment using artificial potential fields and multi-resolution occupancy grids, then, a local path is determined for the entire robot structure by considering the kinematics of the robot as well as the repulsive forces of nearby obstacles in a fuzzy logic controller. Results are shown from a simulator that has been built for this purpose. The contribution of this research is to develop a robust solution for path planning with collision avoidance: one that can be used for various manipulator arms and environment configurations.},

abstract = {Real-time or online 3D reconstruction has wide applicability and receives further interest due to availability of consumer depth cameras. Typical approaches use a moving sensor to accumulate depth measurements into a single model which is continuously refined. Designing such systems is an intricate balance between reconstruction quality, speed, spatial scale, and scene assumptions. Existing online methods either trade scale to achieve higher quality reconstructions of small objects/scenes. Or handle larger scenes by trading real-time performance and/or quality, or by limiting the bounds of the active reconstruction. Additionally, many systems assume a static scene, and cannot robustly handle scene motion or reconstructions that evolve to reflect scene changes. We address these limitations with a new system for real-time dense reconstruction with equivalent quality to existing online methods, but with support for additional spatial scale and robustness in dynamic scenes. Our system is designed around a simple and flat point-Based representation, which directly works with the input acquired from range/depth sensors, without the overhead of converting between representations. The use of points enables speed and memory efficiency, directly leveraging the standard graphics pipeline for all central operations, i.e., camera pose estimation, data association, outlier removal, fusion of depth maps into a single denoised model, and detection and update of dynamic objects. We conclude with qualitative and quantitative results that highlight robust tracking and high quality reconstructions of a diverse set of scenes at varying scales.},

abstract = {The precise localization of human operators in robotic workplaces is an important requirement to be satisfied in order to develop human-robot interaction tasks. Human tracking provides not only safety for human operators, but also context information for intelligent human-robot collaboration. This paper evaluates an inertial motion capture system which registers full-body movements of an user in a robotic manipulator workplace. However, the presence of errors in the global translational measurements returned by this system has led to the need of using another localization system, based on Ultra-WideBand (UWB) technology. A Kalman filter fusion algorithm which combines the measurements of these systems is developed. This algorithm unifies the advantages of both technologies: high data rates from the motion capture system and global translational precision from the UWB localization system. The developed hybrid system not only tracks the movements of all limbs of the user as previous motion capture systems, but is also able to position precisely the user in the environment.},

This paper uses kalman filter fusion algorithm to fuse ultra-wideband (UWB) technology and inertial motion capture system to estimate the motion of human operator in industrial environment. 

The algorithm improves the interaction between a robot and a human operator/user by localizing a human in a manipulator's workspace so that a cooperative interaction can be made. Since the authors use UWB sensor to estimate the location of the human, they use Kalman filtering technique to fuse the information coming from the UWB and the inertial sensors. The filtering technique compensate the low data rate of the UWB and the high error from inertial sensor. Their Kalman filter uses the global position of the UWB as the correction step and the inertial sensor as the prediction step.

Their result shows that by fusing two measurements using kalman filter algorithm, the state estimation of the person's location is increased in accuracy.},

This paper presents FastSLAM, an algorithm that recursively estimates the full posterior distribution over robot pose and landmark locations, yet scales logarithmically with the number of landmarks in the map. This algorithm is based on a factorization of the posterior into a product of conditional landmark distributions and a distribution over robot paths. The algorithm has been run successfully on as many as 50,000 landmarks, environments far beyond the reach of previous approaches. Experimental results demonstrate the advantages and limitations of the FastSLAM algorithm on both simulated and real-world data.},

abstract = {We propose a SPAM (simultaneous planning and mapping) technique for a manipulator-type robot working in an uncertain environment via a novel Best Next Move algorithm. Demands for a smart decision to move a manipulator such as humanoid arms in uncertain or crowded environments call for a simultaneous planning and mapping technique. In the present work, we focus more on rapid map generation rather than global path search to reduce ignorance level of a given environment. The motivation is that the global path quality will be improved as the ignorance level of the unknown environment decreases. The 3D sensor introduced in the previous work has been improved for better mapping capability and the real-time rehearsal idea is used for {\'{i}} µ{\'{i}}±-space cloud point generation. Captured cloud points by 3D sensors, then, create an instantaneous {\'{i}} µ{\'{i}}±-space map whereby the Best Next Move algorithm directs the local motion of the manipulator. The direction of the Best Next Move utilizes the gradient of the density distribution of the {\'{i}} µ{\'{i}}±-nearest-neighborhood sets in {\'{i}} µ{\'{i}}±-space. It has a tendency of traveling along the direction by which the point clouds spread in space, thus rendering faster mapping of {\'{i}} µ{\'{i}}±-space obstacles possible. The proposed algorithm is compared with a sensor-based algorithm such as sensor-based RRT for performance comparison. Performance measures, such as mapping efficiency, search time, and total number of {\'{i}} µ{\'{i}}±-space point clouds, are reported as well. Possible applications include semiautonomous telerobotics planning and humanoid arm path planning.},
annote = {THIS SHOULD GO UNDER UNCERTAINTY IN UNKNOWN ENVIRONMENT

The paper present a simultaneous planning and mapping for a three degree of freedoom manipulator in an unknown environment. The paper argue that their method handle the uncertainty of the unknown environment by using virtual skin concept. The manipulator explores the environment using a mono-vision infrared proximity array (IPA) sensor which replicate the characteristic of a tactile-sensitive skin. From this exploration, the robot would model its configuration space (c-space) and use it as the input for their best-next-move algorithm to optimize path planning.The IPA sensors are attached on each links of the manipulator. Readers should note that an IPA sensor has limited range and noise bound output which add more uncertainty to the estimation of the manipulators c-space. 

The researcher address the noise in the sensor using group average feature (GAF). The point clouds generate from the IPA go through GAF algorithm to produce a more confident map of the c-space. 

The generated map of the c-space is used to provide motion planning for the robot manipulator. The rapidly-exploring random tree (RRT) path planning algorithm use the map as an input to plan the motion of the manipulator. The authors optimized the RRT algorithm with their best next move (BNM) algorithm. BNM is reactive and does not use any inverse kinematic solution. 

They validate the method using and compare the RRT-BNM method with RRT method by simulation and showed that the RRT-BNM method has higher mapping efficiency. They defined mapping efficiency as percentage of map built compared to the actual map, over the number of point clouds in the c-space. Due to the GAF decompression method, the RTT-BNM produce map with less point clouds. 
The author, however, did not repeat the RRT experimentally. 

THE PAPER DID NOT CONCERN WITH LINK POSITION ERROR 
Despite the higher efficiency of RTT-BNM path planning, the map produce does not represent an accurate geometric information of the unknown environment explored by the manipulator. I believe this is because there is a lack of pose estimation of the manipulators link since the research disregard the use of inverse kinematics, bayesian or non-bayesian filtering techniques to reconcile with the path planning.},

abstract = {A probabilistic method for tracking 3D articulated human figures in monocular image sequences is presented. Within a Bayesian framework, we define a generative model of image appearance, a robust likelihood function based on image graylevel differences, and a prior probability distribution over pose and joint angles that models how humans move. The posterior probability distribution over model parameters is represented using a discrete set of samples and is propagated over time using particle filtering. The approach extends previous work on parameterized optical flow estimation to exploit a complex 3D articulated motion model. It also extends previous work on human motion tracking by including a perspective camera model, by modeling limb self occlusion, and by recovering 3D motion from a monocular sequence. The explicit posterior probability distribution represents ambiguities due to image matching, model singularities, and perspective projection. The method relies only on a frame-to-frame assumption of brightness constancy and hence is able to track people under changing viewpoints, in grayscale image sequences, and with complex unknown backgrounds.},

LSD-SLAM use a visual camera to produce point clouds with the help of dbscan algorithm. The scenes generated from the camera are three dimensional. However, the movement of the manipulator is planar. The LSD-SLAM is used to replicate the movement of a human arm. The movement are learned and modeled using Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and the parameters of the model are estimated using Gaussian Mixture Regression (GMR). GMM is a probabilistic model that assume all the data points are generated from a mixture of finite number of Gaussian distribution with unknown parameters. GMR uses Expectation maximization iterative learning algorithm to help replicate an output data based on an input. We observe that, by using GMM and GMR, the authors manage to handle the movement uncertainty of the human operator and map the movement into a planar actuation of the manipulator.

The authors perform an experiment by recording the movement of the human operator. The LSD-SLAM manage to generate a smooth path for the end effector of the manipulator as prescribed by the GMM and GMR based on the demonstration of the operator.},

On the other hand, recent prospective observational studies reported a significant association between the presence of moderate to severe OSA and increased risk of mortality in patients with HF. In randomized trials, treating OSA with continuous positive airway pressure suppressed sympathetic activity, lowered BP, and improved myocardial systolic function in patients with HF. These data suggest the potential for treatment of OSA to improve clinical outcomes for patients with HF. However, large-scale randomized trials with sufficient statistical power will be needed to ascertain whether treatment of OSA will prevent development of, or reduce morbidity and mortality from HF.},

abstract = {This paper presents a large-scale 3D environment mapping solution for mobile robots that is based on hybrid metric-topological maps. If a robot performs simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) while exploring an unknown environment, sometimes loops are closed and the whole SLAM graph has to be optimized. If a conventional occupancy grid mapping algorithm using a monolithic map is used, the whole occupancy grid map has to be rebuilt after optimization, which for large maps can easily become too time consuming for real-time operation. In the same way, path planning on very large occupancy grid maps can become computationally too expensive. Hybrid metric-topological maps can solve both problems. The global metric map is divided into sub-maps and a global topological graph is formed on the map. This allows recomputing only isolated areas of the map, whereas others can remain unchanged. The topological graph allows efficient path planning on the hybrid map. We show that the hybrid mapping approach presented here is considerably faster than conventional methods. Within the same time, it can generate more detailed maps of large environments. The computation time for maps with identical level of detail can be improved by up to two orders of magnitude.},

This enables the planner to identify configuration space paths that minimize uncertainty and, when necessary, efficiently pursue further exploration through utility-guided sensing of the workspace. Experimental results indicate that our utility-guided approach results in a robust planner even in the presence of significant error in its perception of the workspace. Furthermore, we show how the planner is able to reduce the amount of required sensing to compute a successful plan},

abstract = {A scheme for learning to grasp objects using visual information is presented. The learning problem is divided into two separate subproblems: choosing grasping points and predicting the quality of a given grasp. For each grasp we store location parameters that code the locations of the grasping points, quality parameters that are relevant features for the assessment of grasp quality, and the associated grade. The location parameters, using a special coding which is not object specific, are used to locate grasping points on new target objects. A function from the quality parameters to the grade is learned from examples. Grasp quality for novel situations can be generalized and estimated using the learned function. An experimental setup using an AdeptOne manipulator was developed to test this scheme. The system had demonstrated an ability to grasp a relatively wide variety of objects, and its performance had significantly improved with practice following a small number of trials. The knowledge learned for a set of objects was successfully generalized to new objects},

abstract = {ABSTRACT In recent years, commercially available mobile robots, that operate in indoor environments, have found their ways into private homes, office environments, and industrial settings. They fulfill important duties such as transportation, telepresence, and cleaning. While some tasks, such as vacuum cleaning, can be achieved with rudimentary perception, for more complex tasks sophisticated perception capabilities are fundamental for autonomous robots. Even for the mentioned vacuum cleaning, improved perception allows for substantial increases in efficiency. In this thesis, we investigate novel approaches for the modelling of indoor environments for robot navigation. Being an important foundation for higher level skills, a particular focus lies on simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), which allows a robot to construct a model of its environment during operation. In the context of SLAM, we develop an approach for RGB-D cameras, that captures dense 3D maps for robot navigation. For this SLAM system, we propose novel methods to increase the accuracy of the trajectory estimation and the robustness against misassociations during individual motion estimates. Further, we address a major limitation on the hardware side of RGB-D cameras, namely the limited field of view. We investigate SLAM with multiple RGB-D cameras and develop an approach for automated extrinsic calibration of RGB-D cameras via SLAM. We further propose an extension of RGB-D sensors with mirrors to bisect the field of view into two roughly opposite views. While this does not increase the overall information perceived, we show that the divided field of view is beneficial in the context of SLAM. Additionally, we exploit the structural properties of this catadioptric extension to constrain the mentioned calibration method, such that planar motion of the robot is sufficient for online calibration of the two views. To autonomously access all areas in a private home or office, a further key skill for robot navigation is the operation of doors. In this context, we extend the state of the art by novel methods for learning a model of the kinematics and dynamics of a door. We demonstrate that the knowledge about the dynamics of a door allows the robot to accurately predict the motion of the door from inertia. We use this ability to employ a door opening strategy with low requirements on the dexterous workspace of the manipulator. To show the benefits of the approaches proposed in this thesis, we thoroughly evaluate them in experiments with real robots and real sensor data. Overall, the proposed approaches lower the cost of the sensing equipment and the required complexity of the manipulator. These factors are particular important for commercial robots targeted at households and small businesses.},

The grain size was measured by the linear intercept method as a function of density.

abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

Kinematic errors occur because of imperfection in serial robot components, their wear, misalignment and other factors.

-Particle filters is used to estimate the orientation of the end point of the serial robot

-Kalman filter is used to estimate the position of the end point of the serial robot

-The EKF is used to optimize the position and orientation estimation of the end point of the robot. By using the Jacobian matrices, the authors estimate the kinematic erros of the serial robot to manage the uncertainty of using IMU measurements.

They compared their EKF approach to a linear Least Square technique for their estimation of each joints in the robot. The EKF has llower error for all six joint parameters estimation.

abstract = {Online 3D reconstruction is gaining newfound interest due to the availability of real-time consumer depth cameras. The basic problem takes live overlapping depth maps as input and incrementally fuses these into a single 3D model. This is challenging particularly when real-time performance is desired without trading quality or scale. We contribute an online system for large and fine scale volumetric reconstruction based on a memory and speed efficient data structure. Our system uses a simple spatial hashing scheme that compresses space, and allows for real-time access and updates of implicit surface data, without the need for a regular or hierarchical grid data structure. Surface data is only stored densely where measurements are observed. Additionally, data can be streamed efficiently in or out of the hash table, allowing for further scalability during sensor motion. We show interactive reconstructions of a variety of scenes, reconstructing both fine-grained details and large scale environments. We illustrate how all parts of our pipeline from depth map pre-processing, camera pose estimation, depth map fusion, and surface rendering are performed at real-time rates on commodity graphics hardware. We conclude with a comparison to current state-of-the-art online systems, illustrating improved performance and reconstruction quality.},

abstract = {Building a map, localizing within the map, and planning using the map are fundamental prob- lems for mobile robotics. Every mobile robotic system must incorporate some type of solution to all three problems. While the interdependency between mapping and localization is well known as the Simul- taneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) problem, there is a growing understanding in the research community that planning how the robot goes about mapping and exploring an environ- ment (and operating in the environment afterwards) can avoid degenerate conditions and signifi- cantly reduce complexity of SLAM. Thus the task of exploring a new environment combines all three problems, since the robot must plan to find actions that reduce uncertainty in both mapping and localization. This combined problem is known as Active SLAM. Independently, SLAM and planning have been solved in small, two dimensional, structured domains. Robots need to move beyond these simple environments. The challenge is to develop real-time Active SLAM methods that allow robots to explore large, three dimensional, unstruc- tured environments, and allow subsequent operation in these environments over long periods of time. But scaling up to truly large environments requires a second key insight beyond Active SLAM: to circumvent the scale limitations inherent in SLAM, the world can be divided up into more manageable pieces, or submaps. The SLAM problem then becomes a segmented SLAM problem, which represents the world with a combined metric and topological map, building met- ric submaps as necessary and refining the topological relationships between submaps. The contribution of this thesis is a real-time Active SLAM approach that combines a novel evidence grid-based volumetric representation, a robust Rao-Blackwellized particle-filter, a topo- logically flexible submap segmentation framework, and an integrated stochastic planning method for reducing SLAM uncertainty and predicting possible loop closures based on local map struc- ture. We demonstrate our methods on several robotic platforms in both structured and unstruc- tured large, three dimensional environments.},

abstract = {Purpose This paper aims to develop a wearable-based human-manipulator interface which integrates the interval Kalman filter (IKF), unscented Kalman filter (UKF), over damping method (ODM) and adaptive multispace transformation (AMT) to perform immersive human-manipulator interaction by interacting the natural and continuous motion of the human operators hand with the robot manipulator. Design/methodology/approach The interface requires that a wearable watch is tightly worn on the operators hand to track the continuous movements of the operators hand. Nevertheless, the measurement errors generated by the sensor error and tracking failure signicantly occur several times, which means that the measurement is not determined with sufficient accuracy. Due to this fact, IKF and UKF are used to compensate for the noisy and incomplete measurements, and ODM is established to eliminate the influence of the error signals like data jitter. Furthermore, to be subject to the inherent perceptive limitations of the human operator and the motor, AMT that focuses on a secondary treatment is also introduced. Findings Experimental studies on the GOOGOL GRB3016 robot show that such a wearable-based interface that incorporates the feedback mechanism and hybrid filters can operate the robot manipulator more flexibly and advantageously even if the operator is nonprofessional; the feedback mechanism introduced here can successfully assist in improving the performance of the interface. Originality/value The interface uses one wearable watch to simultaneously track the orientation and position of the operators hand; it is not only avoids problems of occlusion, identification and limited operating space, but also realizes a kind of two-way human-manipulator interaction, a feedback mechanism can be triggered in the watch to reflect the system states in real time. Furthermore, the interface gets rid of the synchronization question in posture estimation, as hybrid filters work independently to compensate the noisy measurements respectively. {\textcopyright} Emerald Group Publishing Limited [ISSN 0143-991X].},

For the student, my purpose was to present material in a precise, readable manner, with the concepts and techniques of discrete mathematics clearly presented and demonstrated. My goal was to show the relevance and practicality of discrete mathematics to students, who are often skeptical. I wanted to give students studying computer science all of the mathematical foundations they need for their future studies. I wanted to give mathematics students an understanding of important mathematical concepts together with a sense of why these concepts are important for applications. And most importantly, I wanted to accomplish these goals without watering down the material. For the instructor, my purpose was to design a flexible, comprehensive teaching tool using proven pedagogical techniques in mathematics. I wanted to provide instructors with a package of materials that they could use to teach discrete mathematics effectively and efficiently in the most appropriate manner for their particular set of students. I hope that I have achieved these goals. I have been extremely gratified by the tremendous success of this text. The many improvements in the seventh edition have been made possible by the feedback and suggestions of a large number of instructors and students at many of the more than 600 North American schools, and at any many universities in parts of the world, where this book has been successfully used. This text is designed for a one- or two-term introductory discrete mathematics course taken by students in a wide variety of majors, including mathematics, computer science, and engineering. College algebra is the only explicit prerequisite, although a certain degree of mathematical maturity is needed to study discrete mathematics in a meaningful way. This book has been designed to meet the needs of almost all types of introductory discrete mathematics courses. It is highly flexible and extremely comprehensive. The book is designed not only to be a successful textbook, but also to serve as valuable resource students can consult throughout their studies and professional life.},

Although probabilistic sampling is highly successful for motion planning of robots with many degrees of freedom, sampling-based algorithms typically ignore uncertainty during planning. We introduce the notion of a bounded uncertainty roadmap (BURM) and use it to extend sampling-based algorithms for planning under uncertainty in environment maps. The key idea of our approach is to evaluate uncertainty, represented by collision probability bounds, at multiple resolutions in different regions of the configuration space, depending on their relevance for finding a best path. Preliminary experimental results show that our approach is highly effective: our BURM algorithm is at least 40 times faster than an algorithm that tries to evaluate collision probabilities exactly, and it is not much slower than classic probabilistic roadmap planning algorithms, which ignore uncertainty in environment maps.},

A fast planner is necessary to enable the robot to react to quickly changing human environments.

This capability is critical for future applications in automation and service robotics where humans will work closely with robots to jointly perform tasks.},
annote = {This paper address changing in the workspace of a manipulator. They use dynamic roadmap (DRM) for path planning. They use midpoint workspace as workspace metric. They directly implement the point cloud from 3D sensor to check obstacle in a generate roadmap in a workspace. 

Preprocessing stage: The nodes of the roadmapts are created by sampling a 7-dimensional configuration space of the robot uniformly. These nodes are used to generate roadmaps from start to goal configuration. The initial generated roadmaps from these nodes are encapsulated with grid cells. 

Planning stage: During the planning stage, two search algorithm are used based on the predefined roadmaps. If an obstacle detected, via 3D sensor, near the grid cell that encapsulate the roadmap, or blocked part of the roadmap new path will be generated around the obstacle cell and new roadmaps are determined based on nodes that has been predetermined during preprocessing stage. To connect the start and the goal configuration of the manipulator, the authors use k nearest neighbors for each configuration

Experimentation setup: The authors use SwissRanger SR3000 with Care-O-bot 3. The preprocessing stage takes several hours but the the planning stage takes less than 100 ms to complete. The authors use two search algorithms to search the most optimal roadmap (least number of nodes), which are the A* and the Djikstra's algorithms. The authors conclude that A* search algorithm performs better thatn the Dijkstra algorithm when used with their methods of roadmap building.

We note that the path planning method used in this research only applicable for changes that involve static changes. However, despite being model based on largely open space, the authors remarked that their algorithm performs well even when the obtacles introduce narrow space roadmaps.},

Our approach fuses data from multiple 3D imaging sensors of different modalities into a volumetric evidence grid and segments the volume into regions corresponding to background, robots, and people. Surrounding each robot is a danger zone that dynamically updates according to the robot's position and trajectory. Similarly, surrounding each person is a dynamically updated safety zone. A collision between danger and safety zones indicates an impending actual collision, and the affected robot is stopped until the problem is resolved. We demonstrate and experimentally evaluate the concept in a prototype industrial workcell augmented with stereo and range cameras.},

abstract = {Obstacle detection plays an important role for robot collision avoidance and motion planning. This paper focuses on the study of the collision prediction of a dual-arm robot based on a 3D point cloud. Firstly, a self-identification method is presented based on the over-segmentation approach and the forward kinematic model of the robot. Secondly, a simplified 3D model of the robot is generated using the segmented point cloud. Finally, a collision prediction algorithm is proposed to estimate the collision parameters in real-time. Experimental studies using the Kinect sensor and the Baxter robot have been performed to demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithms.},
annote = {This paper present a method using point clouds to perform self-identification using k-means clustering method and obstacle detection and obstacle avoidance.

The point cloud are used to generate the skeleton and the sphere along the skeleton. The point clouds are sparse and noisy which introduce uncertaity to the self-identification. However, the uncertainty is eliminated using a filter based on the density of the point cloud

The detection of the obstacles are based on the negation of point clouds that are not a part of the skeleton and the sphere that shape the manipulator. This segmentation is the based of their approach to obstacle avoidance.

They tested their algorithm by performing three experiments sequentially using a Baxter manipulator robot with eye in hand configuration. These experiments involve the validation of their self-identification algorithm, obstacle detection algorithm, and obstacle avoidance algorithm. They compare their approach with another work by Rakprayoon et al. (2011) Kinect-based 
obstacle detection for manip-ulator. They report that their method manage to avoid collision even when the obstacle is close to the robot and eliminate unnecessary movements for obstacles far from the manipulator.},

abstract = {In this lecture the group of rigid body motions is introduced via its representation on standard three dimensional Euclidian space. The relevance for robotics is that the links of a robot are usually modelled as rigid bodies. Moreover the payload of a robot is also usually a rigid body and hence much of robotics is concerned with understanding rigid transformations and sequences of these transformations. Chasles's theorem is presented, that is: a general rigid body motion is a screw motion, a rotation about a line in space followed by a translation along the line. The lower Reuleaux pairs are introduced. These are essentially surfaces which are invariant under some subgroup of rigid body motions. Such a surface can be the matting surface for a mechanical joint. In this way the basic mechanical joints used in robots can be classified. These surfaces turn out to have other applications in robotics. In robot gripping they are exactly the surfaces that cannot be immobilised using frictionless fingers. In robot vision the symmetries of these surfaces are motions which cannot be detected. Next Lie algebras are introduced. The 1-parameter rigid motions about a joint are considered. The correspondence between elements of the Lie algebra and 1-degree-of-freedom joints is given. The exponential map from the Lie algebra to the group is defined and used to describe the forward kinematics of a serial robot using the product of exponentials formula. The Rodrigues formula for the exponential map is derived using a set of mutually annihilating idempotents. The derivative of the exponential map is explored. In particular the Jacobian matrix for the forward kinematics is derived. More general results are also derived and these are used to show how the inverse kinematics problem can be cast as a set of ordinary differential equations.},

abstract = { Accurate measurements of positions, velocities, and accelerations in both joint and operational space are required for achieving accurate operational space motion control of robots. Servomotors used for joint actuation are normally equipped with position sensors and optionally with velocity sensors for interlink motion measurements. Further improvements in measurement accuracy can be obtained by equipping the robot arm with accelerometers for absolute acceleration measurement. In this paper, an extended Kalman filter is used for multisensor fusion. The real-time control algorithm was previously based on the assumption of a jerk represented as a processed white noise with the zero mean. In reality, the accelerations are varying in time during the arm motion, and the zero mean assumption is not valid, particularly during fast accelerating periods. In this paper, a model predictive control approach is used for predetermining next-time-step jerk such that the remaining term can be modeled as Gaussian white noise. Experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed sensor fusion approach.},

abstract = {Cable driven power transmission is popular in many manipulator applications including medical arms. In spite of advantages obtained by removing motors from the mechanism, cable transmission introduces higher non-linearity and more uncertainties such as cable stretch and cable coupling. In order to improve the control precision and robustness of the Raven-II surgical robot, particularly for automation applications, the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) was adopted for state estimation. The UKF estimated state variables of the Raven-II dynamic model from sensor data. The dual UKF was used offline to estimate cable coupling parameters. The experimental results showed that the proposed method improved joint position estimation precision and the estimation consistency, especially on the more elastic links. The improvements for links 2 and 3 of the Raven were 36.76{\%}, and 62.99{\%}, respectively. For link 1 the improvement was 1.43{\%} because the transmission is very stiff.},
annote = {This paper address nonlinearity problem of an elastic cable as power transmission between a motor and a joint for a surgical arm. The coupling between the motor and the robot joint reduce armature mass, inertia and size for expert surgery. However, the cable elasticity introduces uncertainty and nonlinearity to the kinematics and the dynamics of the surgical arm. 

The authors introduce an estimation method that uses a standard unscented Kalman filter (UKF) and a square root Kalman filter (srUKF) to estimate cable coupling parameter and the position of the end effector (end point) in real-time.

The authors implement their method using the Raven-II, a seven degree of freedom serial manipulator, as their surgical arm. The surgical arm is equip with an optical encoder attached to the motors and position sensor on each joint for data validation. In their research, the authors only address the first three joint for state estimation of the Raven-II.

They model the armature dynamics using forward and inverse dynamis with Newton-Euler equations . Their inverse dynamic solution is based on the recursive Newton-Euler algorithm.

The Newton-Euler equations requires model parameters. The authors identify the initial inertial matrices, mass and the center of mass of the system using a computer aided design model. 
The authors use srUKF to estimate the joint angle and joint position of the surgical arm online. Also, the authors use the standard UKF to estimate the coupling parameter offline. They compute spring constant, damping constant, coulomb and viscous friction of the motor side and the joint side experimentally (empirically) translate into a table?

They validate their method experimentally using three different design. The first two experiments involve changing the cable tension and the third experiment involve picking an object of the mass 100 g under high cable tension. They compared the reuslt of the three experiment between the dynamic model that uses their UKF estimation and the dynamic model that has no filtering technique. They improved the accuracy of the joints position to 1.433{\%}, 36.76{\%}, and 62.99{\%} for joints 1, 2 and 3 respectively},

abstract = {The recent development of various methods of modulation such as PCM and PPM which exchange bandwidth for signal-to-noise ratio has intensified the interest in a general theory of communication. A basis for such a theory is contained in the important papers of Nyquist and Hartley on this subject. In the present paper we will extend the theory to include a number of new factors, in particular the effect of noise in the channel, and the savings possible due to the statistical structure of the original message and due to the nature of the final destination of the information. The fundamental problem of communication is that of reproducing at one point either exactly or approximately a message selected at another point. Frequently the messages have meaning; that is they refer to or are correlated according to some system with certain physical or conceptual entities. These semantic aspects of communication are irrelevant to the engineering problem. The significant aspect is that the actual message is one selected from a set of possible messages. The system must be designed to operate for each possible selection, not just the one which will actually be chosen since this is unknown at the time of design. If the number of messages in the set is finite then this number or any monotonic function of this number can be regarded as a measure of the information produced when one message is chosen from the set, all choices being equally likely. As was pointed out by Hartley the most natural choice is the logarithmic function. Although this definition must be generalized considerably when we consider the influence of the statistics of the message and when we have a continuous range of messages, we will in all cases use an essentially logarithmic measure.},

abstract = {We present a hierarchical and adaptive mobile manipulator planner (HAMP) that plans for both the base and the arm in a judicious manner---allowing the manipulator to change its configuration autonomously when needed if the current arm configuration is in collision with the environment as the mobile manipulator moves along the planned path. This is in contrast to current implemented approaches that are conservative and fold the arm into a fixed home configuration. Our planner first constructs a base roadmap and then for each node in the roadmap it checks for collision status of current manipulator configuration along the edges formed with adjacent nodes, if the current manipulator configuration is in collision, the manipulator C-space is searched for a new reachable configuration such that it is collision-free as the mobile manipulator moves along the edge and a path from current configuration to the new reachable configuration is computed. We show that HAMP is probabilistically complete. We compared HAMP with full 9D PRM and observed that the full 9D PRM is outperformed by HAMP in each of the performance criteria, i.e., computational time, percentage of successful attempts, base path length, and most importantly, undesired motions of the arm. We also evaluated the tree versions of HAMP, with RRT and bi-directional RRT as core underlying sub-planners, and observed similar advantages, although the time saving for bi-directional RRT version is modest. We then present an extension of HAMP (we call it HAMP-U) that uses belief space planning to account for localization uncertainty associated with the mobile base position and ensures that the resultant path for the mobile manipulator has low uncertainty at the goal. Our experimental results show that the paths generated by HAMP-U are less likely to result in collision and are safer to execute than those generated by HAMP (without incorporating uncertainty), thereby showing the importance of incorporating base pose uncertainty in our overall HAMP algorithm.},

abstract = {The problem of estimating position and orientation (pose) of an object in real time constitutes an important issue for vision-based control of robots. Many vision-based pose-estimation schemes in robot control rely on an extended Kalman filter (EKF) that requires tuning of filter parameters. To obtain satisfactory results, EKF-based techniques rely on “known” noise statistics, initial object pose, and sufficiently high sampling rates for good approximation of measurement-function linearization. Deviations from such assumptions usually lead to degraded pose estimation during visual servoing. In this paper, a new algorithm, namely iterative adaptive EKF (IAEKF), is proposed by integrating mechanisms for noise adaptation and iterative-measurement linearization. The experimental results are provided to demonstrate the superiority of IAEKF in dealing with erroneous a priori statistics, poor pose initialization, variations in the sampling rate, and trajectory dynamics.},

This paper demonstrate an adaptive iterative extended Kalman filter (AIEKF) in the absence of accurate inital pose, noise matrix, and covariance matrix at variant sampling rate during robotic visual servoing. Visual servoing is a process of estimating the configuration of a manipulator using images or visual feedbacks.

They experimented on a six degree of freedom cartesian manipulator AFMA-6 with eye-in-hand camera configuration. The robot moves at a predefined trajectory under different condition. Each separate experimentation involves increasing the velocity of the end effector, changing the covariance matrices, changing the sampling time for estimation, and changing the intial positions of the end effector. They compared three other Kalman filtering techniques (extended Kalman filter, adaptive extended Kalman filter, and iterative extended Kalman filter) with the IAEKF. They conclude that IAEKF can improve pose estimation at during uncertain initial position and covariance matrix estimation, high motion, and slow sampling rate},

In this paper we present a novel feature-based monocular SLAM system that is more robust, gives more accurate camera poses, and obtains comparable or better semi-dense reconstructions than the cur- rent state of the art. Our semi-dense mapping operates over keyframes, optimized by local bundle adjustment, allowing to obtain accurate triangulations from wide baselines. Our novel method to search correspondences, the measurement fusion and the inter-keyframe depth consistency tests allow to obtain clean reconstructions with very few outliers. Against the current trend in direct SLAM, our experiments show that by decoupling the semi-dense reconstruction from the trajectory computation, the results obtained are better. This opens the discussion on the benefits of features even if a semi-dense reconstruction is desired.},

abstract = {—With advancing technologies, robotic manipulators and visual environment sensors are becoming cheaper and more widespread. However, robot control can be still a limiting factor for better adaptation of these technologies. Robotic manipulators are performing very well in structured workspaces, but do not adapt well to unexpected changes, like people entering the workspace. We present a method combining 3D Camera based workspace mapping, and a predictive and reflexive robot manipulator trajectory estimation to allow more efficient and safer operation in dynamic workspaces. In experiments on a real UR5 robot our method has proven to provide shorter and smoother trajectories compared to a reactive trajectory planner in the same conditions. Furthermore, the robot has successfully avoided any contact by initialising the reflexive movement even when an obstacle got unexpectedly close to the robot. The main goal of our work is to make the operation more flexible in unstructured dynamic workspaces and not just avoid obstacles, but also adapt when performing collaborative tasks with humans in the near future.},
annote = {Mapping by Octomap

The author use the background of shared human-robot workspace as their problem statement. 
Method: Point clouds from the cameras are pre-processed using Statisitcal Outlier Removal algorithm to reject outliers. They proceed by merging point cloud data from two 3D cameras (Kinect Sensor) using iterative closest point. Iterative closest point (ICP) is often used in mobile robot to combine two scans collected at different position together. They use forward kinematic to assist in replacing point clouds corresponding to the robots chassis with cylindrical shapes. The map of the environment are model using octomap and embedded each grid cell with a decaying occupancy value. The decaying cost value are used to represent danger zone, a mediary zone, and a non-danger zone in the map for a reflexive and predictive behaviors. Building their path planning on top of these map provde a responsive motion even if the robot workspace is populated by moving objects. 


setup: the authors uses 6DOF UR5 robot. The authors adopt a eye-to-hand approach.

validation: they validate their method by simulating a predifined back and forth motion between a start configuration and a goal configuration. The first simulation act as the baseline or the benchmark of their path planning approach using only Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT). The second and the third experiments introduce a moving object into the robot's workspace but a reactive path planning and the reflexive-predictive path planning approaches are used respectively. They concluded that although experiments 3 performs at the shortest time, the result was not significant. 

ICP use in this method is computationally expensive because it involves direct point clouds.},

They excel at both precision and speed in repetitive jobs and can cooperate with humans in complex tasks within dynamic environments. Self-localization is critical to any robot that must navigate or manipulate the environment. To solve this problem, a modular localization system suitable for mobile manipulators was developed. By using LIDAR data the proposed system is capable of achieving less than a centimeter in translation error and less than a degree in rotation error while requiring only 5 to 25 milliseconds of processing time. The system was tested in two different robot platforms at different velocities and in several cluttered and dynamic environments. It demonstrated high accuracy while performing pose tracking and high reliability when estimating the initial pose using feature matching. No artificial landmarks are required and it is able to adjust its operation rate in order to use very few hardware resources when a mobile robot is not moving.},

The exact dynamics of parallel-structured two-link flexible manipulators is described by nonlinear partial and ordinary differential equations having considerable complexity. Here, manipulators are modeled approximately by a two-link flexible manipulator consisting of a pair of flexible beams under the same boundary conditions as the original system. To discover the instant at which the flexible manipulator collides with an unknown obstacle, the innovation of the Unscented Kalman Filter - a nonlinear state estimator - is introduced. To control the manipulator, a sliding mode controller is employed. Under the normal conditions, the sliding mode controller generates control torques such that the tip position of the manipulator follows a given reference trajectory. However, when collision between the flexible manipulator and an obstacle is detected, the controller switches from position control to suspend control by changing the reference trajectory. The performance of the proposed collision detection algorithm and controller is demonstrated via two numerical simulations. {\textcopyright} 2012 ISSN 1349-4198.},

The authors suggest the use of Euler-Langrange equations to represent the model of the manipulator dynamics given that each joints are model by torsional spring. 

To better estimate the acceleration and jerk of each link in the four-bar linkage, the linearization are manage using extended and unscented Kalman filters. 

The author validated their observer model by simulation and conclude that the accelaration and jerk of the manipulator's linkages are succesfully estimated.},

abstract = {Vision-aided inertial navigation systems (V-INSs) can provide precise state estimates for the 3-D motion of a vehicle when no external references (e.g., GPS) are available. This is achieved by combining inertial measurements from an inertial measurement unit (IMU) with visual observations from a camera under the assumption that the rigid transformation between the two sensors is known. Errors in the IMU-camera extrinsic calibration process cause biases that reduce the estimation accuracy and can even lead to divergence of any estimator processing the measurements from both sensors. In this paper, we present an extended Kalman filter for precisely determining the unknown transformation between a camera and an IMU. Contrary to previous approaches, we explicitly account for the time correlation of the IMU measurements and provide a figure of merit (covariance) for the estimated transformation. The proposed method does not require any special hardware (such as spin table or 3-D laser scanner) except a calibration target. Furthermore, we employ the observability rank criterion based on Lie derivatives and prove that the nonlinear system describing the IMU-camera calibration process is observable. Simulation and experimental results are presented that validate the proposed method and quantify its accuracy.},

We propose to split tracking and mapping into two separate tasks, processed in parallel threads on a dual-core computer: one thread deals with the task of robustly tracking erratic hand-held motion, while the other produces a 3D map of point features from previously observed video frames. This allows the use of computationally expensive batch optimisation techniques not usually associated with real-time operation: The result is a system that produces detailed maps with thousands of landmarks which can be tracked at frame-rate, with an accuracy and robustness rivalling that of state-of-the-art model-based systems.},

abstract = {The successful development of autonomous robotic systems requires careful fusion of complex subsystems for perception, planning, and control. Often these subsystems are designed in a modular fashion and tested individually. However, when ultimately combined with other components to form a complete system, unexpected interactions between subsystems can occur that make it difficult to isolate the source of problems. This paper presents a novel paradigm for robot experimentation that enables unified testing of individual subsystems while acting as part of a complete whole made up of both virtual and real components. We exploit the recent advances in speed and accuracy of optical motion capture to localize the robot, track environment objects, and extract extrinsic parameters for moving cameras in real-time. We construct a world model representation that serves as ground truth for both visual and tactile sensors in the environment. From this data, we build spatial and temporal correspondences between virtual elements, such as motion plans, and real artifacts in the scene. The system enables safe, decoupled testing of component algorithms for vision, motion planning and control that would normally have to be tested simultaneously on actual hardware. We show results of successful online applications in the development of an autonomous humanoid robot.},

They use examples of motion planning in lower dimensionality problem or problems in low-dimensional manifold as a heuristic for motion planning in higher dimensional manifold. From this heuristic, they define motion primitives, a predefine motions of a single joint, and used them to minimize the cost function so that the most optimal path can be realized. This method eliminated the multiple solution to start-to-goal configuration by selecting the most feasible path that avoids collision which may not have the shortest path. They coined their searching-based planner as ARA*. ARA* is different from A* algorithm because A* always aims at getting into a goal configuration at the shortest travesal. ARA* is different in the sense because initially, the selection of path is based on the feasibility of getting into the goal configuration without any collision.

They use occupancy grid map to decrease the intractability of their algorithm so that the ARA motion planner produce the most optimum solution in path planning. They manage the uncertainty of multiple path solution by eliminating it using cost function as constraint to their path planning algorithm.

Validation: they validate their approach by simulating manipulation in a cluttered tabletop and conclude that their approach are only optimal for three degree of freedom pose (translational) rather than a ful six degree of freedom pose (translational in x,y, and z directions together with orientation about the x, y and z lines)

abstract = {This paper presents a contribution to programming by human demonstration, in the context of compliant-motion task specification for sensor-controlled robot systems that physically interact with the environment. One wants to learn about the geometric parameters of the task and segment the total motion executed by the human into subtasks for the robot, that can each be executed with simple compliant-motion task specifications. The motion of the human demonstration tool is sensed with a 3-D camera, and the interaction with the environment is sensed with a force sensor in the human demonstration tool. Both measurements are uncertain, and do not give direct information about the geometric parameters of the contacting surfaces, or about the contact formations (CFs) encountered during the human demonstration. The paper uses a Bayesian sequential Monte Carlo method (also known as a particle filter) to do the simultaneous estimation of the CF (discrete information) and the geometric parameters (continuous information). The simultaneous CF segmentation and the geometric parameter estimation are helped by the availability of a contact state graph of all possible CFs. The presented approach applies to all compliant-motion tasks involving polyhedral objects with a known geometry, where the uncertain geometric parameters are the poses of the objects. This work improves the state of the art by scaling the contact estimation to all possible contacts, by presenting a prediction step based on the topological information of a contact state graph, and by presenting efficient algorithms that allow the estimation to operate in real time. In real-world experiments, it is shown that the approach is able to discriminate in real time between some 250 different CFs in the graph},
annote = {This paper present an approach to generate a path planning by human demonstration for a sensor based manipulator. A tool containing optical markers are tracked during demonstration phase using a 3D vision sensor (a Krypton 6D Optical System). The tool is attached to a geometrically uncertain object in a controlled environment. 

The use of 3D vision sensor, and the estimation of the state of the tool and indirect estimation of force asserted by the tool based on the state of the tool introduce uncertainty. To compromise the uncertainty, the authors use particle filtering technique to estimate:
the pose and twist of the manipulated object via tracking of the manipulating tool 
the force between the contacting object

The researcher address their previous work on the same problem and optimize the particle filter with toplogical graph called contact-state graph to predict the next best configuration of the object being moved or contact formation. They observed that the contact-state graph reduce the number of particles used during sampling which decrease computational load and increase accuracy in their estimation. 

The paper however did not replicate their simulation in an experimentation with an actual manipulator},

abstract = {An intuitive, yet precise introduction to probability theory, stochastic processes, and probabilistic models used in science, engineering, economics, and related fields. The 2nd edition is a substantial revision of the 1st edition, involving a reorganization of old material and the addition of new material. The length of the book has increased by about 25 percent. The main new feature of the 2nd edition is thorough introduction to Bayesian and classical statistics. The book is the currently used textbook for "Probabilistic Systems Analysis," an introductory probability course at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, attended by a large number of undergraduate and graduate students. The book covers the fundamentals of probability theory (probabilistic models, discrete and continuous random variables, multiple random variables, and limit theorems), which are typically part of a first course on the subject, as well as the fundamental concepts and methods of statistical inference, both Bayesian and classical. It also contains, a number of more advanced topics, from which an instructor can choose to match the goals of a particular course. These topics include transforms, sums of random variables, a fairly detailed introduction to Bernoulli, Poisson, and Markov processes. The book strikes a balance between simplicity in exposition and sophistication in analytical reasoning. Some of the more mathematically rigorous analysis has been just intuitively explained in the text, but is developed in detail (at the level of advanced calculus) in the numerous solved theoretical problems. Written by two professors of the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and members of the prestigious US National Academy of Engineering, the book has been widely adopted for classroom use in introductory probability courses within the USA and abroad.From a Review of the 1st Edition:...it trains the intuition to acquire probabilistic feeling. This book explains every single concept it enunciates. This is its main strength, deep explanation, and not just examples that happen to explain. Bertsekas and Tsitsiklis leave nothing to chance. The probability to misinterpret a concept or not understand it is just... zero. Numerous examples, figures, and end-of-chapter problems strengthen the understanding. Also of invaluable help is the book's web site, where solutions to the problems can be found-as well as much more information pertaining to probability, and also more problem sets. --Vladimir Botchev, Analog Dialogue Several other reviews can be found in the listing of the first edition of this book.

annote = {THIS PAPER IS GOOD FOR AN INTRODUCTION FOR PF

The paper describe particle filter by fusing data from an IMU and joint encoders to estimating pose of the end effector.

The purpose of this paper is to estimate the state vector of a three degree of freedom industrial robot 
using accelerometer and an encoder for each joint. The estimated state vector is used to generate appropriate control signal for the manipulators

Accelerometer are notorious for being nonlinear. Also, with encoder as the primary feedback for joint measurements, the state of the manipulator becomes non-linear and uncertain. The uncertainty introduced from the sensors and the link material are managed using particle filtering technique.

The authors use particle filter to perform data fusion between an accelerometer and an encoder to estimate the pose of the end effector. Readers should note that both accelerometers and encoders has non-gaussian behavior. This is more pronounce if the joints are flexible which introduce nonlinearity to the state (position of the end effector) of the manipulator.

Particle filter is used simply because it is nonparametric. This mean that the parameter of a normal distribution are not assumed. Instead, PF perform the estimation based on the sampled data and generate the distribution from these samples. The method of sampling provide a general solution that has no presumption of sensor characteristics. This also means that with particle filters, more accessable sensors such as an accelerometer or an IMU can be used without scaling down accuracy. 

The state vector estimation was compared with extended kalman filtering technique. The authors observe higher accuracy in estimation of the state vector for PF compared to EKF technique. However, the author caution the selection of particles numbers may improve accuracy with the expense of computational load.},

In this work, we present a calibration method for dynamic multi-camera clusters, where one or more of the cluster cameras is mounted to an actuated mechanism, such as a gimbal or robotic manipulator. Our calibration approach parametrizes the actuated mechanism using the Denavit-Hartenberg convention, then determines the calibration parameters which allow for the estimation of the time varying extrinsic transformations between camera frames. We validate our calibration approach using a dynamic camera cluster consisting of a static camera and a camera mounted to a pan-tilt unit, and demonstrate that the dynamic camera cluster can provide accurate tracking when used to perform SLAM.},

annote = {The paper present a path planning strategy to perform autonomous grit-blasting as a part of bridge maintenance process. They developed a framework called Autonomous eXploration to BUild a Map (AXBAM). AXBAM define the uncertainty in an unknown environment as the measurement of information that has not been discovered in the environment by using Shanon's entropy definition of information theory. This is an appropriate concept to use in modeling an unknown environment since the theory help in optimizing the exploration and path planning of a manipulator. The authors use Occupancy Grid map concept to handle uncertainty for path plannin in the unknown environment based on the entropy definition. The authors implement ellipsoid force-field planner to plan collision free roadmap. 

Another problem addressed by the authors states that there are possibilities for multiple goal configuration and use their entropy model to arrive to a single goal configuration with the highest information gain prediction. 

Despite the use of occupancy map in managing the control of their manipulator under uncertain environment, the mapping model in this paper uses direct point clouds for detailed geometric representation of the unknown environment. However, the author fails to show any optimization of registrating local scans into a global scans. We believe without this optimization, if the pose of the end effector is uncertain, their map may have diverging misalignment. 

The authors uses Hokuyo Laser Range Finder (Hokuyo URG-04LX) as a scanning sensor attached on a six degrees of freedom Denso VM-6093 manipulator arm with eye-in-hand configuration. The 5th joint rotates to facilitate the intial scanning of the environment before exploration commence. Based on this intial scan, the robot will start exploring. By using AXBAM, the authors claim to reduce computation in decision making during exploration.},

Substantially better end-effector position estimation and control performance would be obtainable if direct measurements of its end-effector position were also used. The subject of this paper is extended Kalman filtering for precise estimation of the position of the end-effector of a robot using, in addition to the usual measurements of the joint positions, direct measurements of the end-effector position. The estimation performances of extended Kalman filters are compared in applications to a planar two-axis robotic arm with very flexible links. The comparisons shed new light on the dependence of extended Kalman filter estimation performance on the quality of the model of the arm dynamics that the extended Kalman filter operates with.},
annote = {state estimation for end effector for robot with Flexible links

The authors uses extended kalman filter to estimate the position of the end effector of two axis robotic arm together with the joint measurement for highly flexible links in real time

UNCERTAINTY: the location of the end effector due to the flexible links 

SETUP: The authors use two link manipulator. Each joint has optical encoders and the end point has a reflective infrared-light emitter 

MODEL: The deflection of each links is modeled using the deflection beam model. 
The dynamic equations of the manipulator are derived from Kane's method.

LINEARIZATION: They linearixe the dynamic equation by eliminating the non-linear terms that involve the generalized elastic coordinates and their derivatives in the inertial matrix and the velocity vector. They coined the linearization method as a 'ruthless linearization'

The extended kalman filter is used to estimate the position of the end effector using the differential equation solution of the dynamic equation which was solved using Runge-Kutta method. 

Their result shows that with ruthlessly linearized model, the EKF can estimate the position of the end effector consistently during low-speed and high-speed slew maneuvers compared to continuosly linearized model of the dynamic model

THIS PAPER CAN BE USED AS AN ARGUMENT THAT LINEARIZATION OF MODEL BEFORE THE USE OF EKF AFFECTS THE PERFORMANCE OF THE FILTERING TECHNIQUE.},

Perhaps the single most important design technique is modeling, the art of abstracting a messy real-world application into a clean problem suitable for algorithmic attack. * Resources - Good algorithm designers stand on the shoulders of giants. Rather than laboring from scratch to produce a new algorithm for every task, they can figure out what is known about a particular problem. Rather than re-implementing popular algorithms from scratch, they seek existing implementations to serve as a starting point.

abstract = {Techniques that jointly perform dense 3D reconstruction and semantic segmentation have recently shown very promising results. One major restriction so far is that they can often only handle a very low number of semantic labels. This is mostly due to their high memory consumption caused by the necessity to store indicator variables for every label and transition. We propose a way to reduce the memory consumption of existing methods. Our approach is based on the observation that many semantic labels are only present at very localized positions in the scene, such as cars. Therefore this label does not need to be active at every location. We exploit this observation by dividing the scene into blocks in which generally only a subset of labels is active. By determining early on in the reconstruction process which labels need to be active in which block the memory consumption can be significantly reduced. In order to recover from mistakes we propose to update the set of active labels during the iterative optimization procedure based on the current solution. We also propose a way to initialize the set of active labels using a boosted classifier. In our experimental evaluation we show the reduction of memory usage quantitatively. Eventually, we show results of joint semantic 3D reconstruction and semantic segmentation with significantly more labels than previous approaches were able to handle.},

abstract = {In this article, we present an approach for the fusion of 2d and 3d measurements for model-based person tracking, also known as Human Motion Capture. The applied body model is defined geometrically with generalized cylinders, and is set up hierarchically with connecting joints of different types. The joint model can be parameterized to control the degrees of freedom, adhesion and stiffness. This results in an articulated body model with constrained kinematic degrees of freedom. The fusion approach incorporates this model knowledge together with the measurements, and tracks the target body iteratively with an extended Iterative Closest Point (ICP) approach. Generally, the ICP is based on the concept of correspondences between measurements and model, which is normally exploited to incorporate 3d point cloud measurements. The concept has been generalized to represent and incorporate also 2d image space features. Together with the 3D point cloud from a 3d time-of-flight (ToF) camera, arbitrary features, derived from 2D camera images, are used in the fusion algorithm for tracking of the body. This gives complementary information about the tracked body, enabling not only tracking of depth motions but also turning movements of the human body, which is normally a hard problem for markerless human motion capture systems. The resulting tracking system, named VooDoo is used to track humans in a Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) context. We only rely on sensors on board the robot, i.e. the color camera, the ToF camera and a laser range finder. The system runs in realtime (∼20 Hz) and is able to robustly track a human in the vicinity of the robot. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {We investigate the problem of using contact sensors to estimate the pose of an object during planar pushing by a fixed-shape hand. Contact sensors are unique because they inherently discriminate between "contact" and "no-contact" configurations. As a result, the set of object configurations that activates a sensor constitutes a lower-dimensional contact manifold in the configuration space of the object. This causes conventional state estimation methods, such as the particle filter, to perform poorly during periods of contact due to particle starvation. In this paper, we introduce the manifold particle filter as a principled way of solving the state estimation problem when the state moves between multiple manifolds of different dimensionality. The manifold particle filter avoids particle starvation during contact by adaptively sampling particles that reside on the contact manifold from the dual proposal distribution. We describe three techniques, one analytical and two sample-based, of sampling from the dual proposal distribution and compare their relative strengths and weaknesses. We present simulation results that show that all three techniques outperform the conventional particle filter in both speed and accuracy. In addition, we implement the manifold particle filter on a real robot and show that it successfully tracks the pose of a pushed object using commercially available tactile sensors.},
annote = {The author present a situation where constant contact and manipulation of an object, by pushing the object, can be used to estimate the state of the object; i. e. the position and the orientation of the object. They term the process as contact manipulation. 

They argue that with the absence of more conventional observation from sensors such as a laser range finder and a vision camera, tactile based sensor can perform state estimation using appropriate filtering technique. Since tactile sensor has non-gaussian characteristic and highly nonlinear, the authors used particle filter as their estimator. 

The use of tactile sensor, however, introduce uncertainty because the sensor has low spatial resolution or low manifold. This is regarded as a low-dimensional manifold problem where the state estimation has higher dimensionality (two for position on a plane and one for orientation). Although intuitively increasing the resolution of the tactile sensor may decrease the spatial uncertainty, it is not the case for tactile sensing with particle filtering technique. Thus, the authors introduce manifold particle filter. (MPF).

An MPF reduce the dimensionality of the state estimation by marginalizing the probability distribution of the state of the object based on the observation from the tactile sensing and use it as a prior estimate.

To implement the MPF, the state estimation follows three steps:
(a) assumption of the state of the object by evenly weighting particles
(b) action which involve pushing the object
(c) observation where the MPF use the pressure profile during pushing to estimate the state of the object.

They implement the algorithm using OpenRAVE simulation environment and evaluate it with a simulated BarrettHand. They then run an experiment using Andy, a robot module developed for Darpa ARM-S competition. They compared their result with a conventional particle filter (CPF) and imporved estimation of the object state.},

By just looking at the scene they can decide which places or objects they can easily reach and which are difficult to approach. Possessing a similar abstraction of a robot arm's capabilities in its workspace is important for grasp planners, path planners and task planners. In this paper, we show that robot arm capabilities manifest themselves as directional structures specific to workspace regions. We introduce a representation scheme that enables to visualize and inspect the directional structures. The directional structures are then captured in the form of a map, which we name the capability map. Using this capability map, a manipulator is able to deduce places that are easy to reach. Furthermore, a manipulator can either transport an object to a place where versatile manipulation is possible or a mobile manipulator or humanoid torso can position itself to enable optimal manipulation of an object.},

abstract = {Model verification and validation (V{\&}V) is an enabling methodology for the development of computational models that can be used to make engineering predictions with quantified confidence. Model V{\&}V procedures are needed by government and industry to reduce the time, cost, and risk associated with full-scale test ing of products, materials, and weapon systems. Quantifying the confidence and predictive accuracy of model calculations provides the decision-maker with the information necessary for making high-consequence decisions. The development of guidelines and procedures for conducting a model V{\&}V program are currently being defined by a broad spectrum of researchers. This report reviews the concepts involved in such a program. Model V{\&}V is a current topic of great interest to both government and industry. In response to a ban on the production of new strategic weapons and nuclear testing, the Department of Energy (DOE) initiated the Science- Based Stockpile Stewardship Program (SSP). An objective of the SSP is to maintain a high level of confidence in the safety, reliability, and performance of the existing nuclear weapons stockpile in the absence of nuclear testing. This objective has challenged the national laboratories to develop high-confidence tools and methods that can be used to provide credible models needed for stockpile certification via numerical simulation. There has been a significant increase in activity recent ly to define V{\&}V methods and procedures. The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) Modeling and Simulation Office (DMSO) is working to develop fundamental concepts and terminology for V{\&}V applied to high-level systems such as ballistic missile defense and battle management simulations. The American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) has recently formed a Standards Committee for the development of V{\&}V procedures for computational solid mechanics models. The Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board (DNFSB) has been a proponent of model V{\&}V for all safety-related nuclear facility design, analyses, and operations. In fact, DNFSB 2002-1 1 recommends to the DOE and National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) that a V{\&}V process be performed for all safety related software and analysis. Model verification and validation are the primary processes for quantifying and building credibility in numerical models. Verification is the process of determining that a model implementation accurately represents the developer's conceptual description of the model and its solution. Validation is the process of determining the degree to which a model is an accurate representation of the real world from the perspective of the intended uses of the model. Both verification and validation are processes that accumulat e evidence of a model's correctness or accuracy for a specific scenario; thus, V{\&}V cannot prove that a model is co rrect and accurate for all possible scenarios, but, rather, it can provide evidence that the model is sufficiently accurate for its intended use. vi Model V{\&}V is fundamentally different from software V{\&}V. Code developers developing computer programs perform software V{\&}V to ensure code correctness, reliability, and robustness. In model V{\&}V, the end product is a predictive model based on fundamental physics of the problem being solved. In all applications of practical interest, the calculations involved in obtaining solutions with the mode l require a computer code, e.g., finite element or finite difference analysis. Therefore, engineers seeking to devel op credible predictive models critically need model V{\&}V guidelines and procedures. The expected outcome of the model V{\&} V process is the quantified level of agreement between experimental data and model prediction, as well as the predictive accuracy of the model. This report attempts to describe the general philosophy, definitions, concepts, and processes for conducting a successful V{\&}V program. This objective is motivated by the need for highly accurate numerical models for making predictions to support the SSP, and also by the lack of guidelines, standards and procedures for performing V{\&}V for complex numerical models.},

The presented work is the result of a collaboration of three PR2 beta sites. We rigorously evaluated our approach on 29 cabinets in five real kitchens located at our institutions. These kitchens contained 13 drawers, 12 doors, 2 refrigerators and 2 dishwashers. We evaluated the overall performance of detecting the handle of a novel cabinet, operating it and storing its model in a semantic map.

The texture of the shells is governed by microporosity yielding the major part of the total surface area. A detailed investigation of thermal decomposition, crystallization, and grain growth behavior was carried out under constant heating rate conditions. The decomposition products are nanocrystalline Sm2O3 and MgO and corresponding two-phase nanocomposites. The pure samarium carboxylate gel features considerably higher thermal stability compared with the one comprised of only magnesium. Accordingly the decomposition behavior of mixed samples is dependent on the Sm/Mg ratio. Furthermore it is shown that small amounts of MgO are able to slow down the kinetics of grain growth of Sm2O3 whereas high amounts are necessary to significantly reduce the final grain size at 1000 degrees C.},

Further, the behavior of distributions around contractual fee triggers is consistent with an underlying agency conflict between investors and fund managers.

abstract = {The concept of C-space entropy for sensor-based exploration and view planning for general robot-sensor systems has been introduced in [?], [?], [?], [?]. The robot plans the next sensing action (also called the next best view) to maximize the expected C-space entropy reduction, (known as Maximal expected Entropy Reduction, or MER). It gives priority to those areas that increase the maneuverable space around the robot, taking into account its physical size and shape, thereby facilitating reachability for further views. However, previous work had assumed a Poisson point process model for obstacle distribution in the physical space, a simplifying assumption. In this paper we derive an expression for MER criterion assuming an occupancy grid map, a commonly used representation for workspace representation in much of the mobile robot community. This model is easily obtained from typical range sensors such as laser range finders, stereo vision, etc., and furthermore, we can incorporate occlusion constraints and their effect in the MER formulation, making it more realistic. Simulations show that even for holonomic mobile robots with relatively simple geometric shapes (such as a rectangle), the MER criterion yields improvement in exploration efficiency (number of views needed to explore the C-space) over physical space based criteria.},

Some exteroceptive sensors like sonars and laser rangefinders are available on the mobile platform, some others are mounted on the end-effector of the manipulator: a colour camera, able to locate objects to operate with; an ultrasound range finder, near the camera, that will be used to get distance measures. In this paper we consider the problem of relocalising the mobile manipulator in a known environment supposing that no base movement is allowed to avoid hazard operations. As only the arm can be safely panned to explore the surroundings, the proposed procedure is based exclusively on the ultrasound rangefinder. Using such measures, and making the hypothesis that the arm configuration in known, a Monte Carlo filter is designed to estimate the base pose. Such multiple hypotheses filter is appropriate in this kind of problems where, in the best case, it is possible to retrieve a finite number of possible poses compatible with available measures},

Tests demonstrate its ability to avoid unreliable paths in fully explored environments as compared to other uncertainty based criteria. In the exploration scenario, potential paths not present in the original graph are proposed using Voronoi Diagram of the space ahead observed by the sensors. A cost function is proposed considering the length of the path as well as the expected final uncertainty, thus including potentially shorter, but still reliable paths. Tests demonstrate the shortest path is preferred as long as it contains loop closures with low uncertainty.},

abstract = {Micro aerial vehicles, such as multirotors, are particularly well suited for the autonomous monitoring, inspection, and surveillance of buildings, e.g., for maintenance or disaster management. Key prerequisites for the fully autonomous operation of micro aerial vehicles are real-time obstacle detection and planning of collision-free trajectories. In this article, we propose a complete system with a multimodal sensor setup for omnidirectional obstacle perception consisting of a three-dimensional (3D) laser scanner, two stereo camera pairs, and ultrasonic distance sensors. Detected obstacles are aggregated in egocentric local multiresolution grid maps. Local maps are efficiently merged in order to simultaneously build global maps of the environment and localize in these. For autonomous navigation, we generate trajectories in a multilayered approach: from mission planning over global and local trajectory planning to reactive obstacle avoidance. We evaluate our approach and the involved components in simulation and with the real autonomous micro aerial vehicle. Finally, we present the results of a complete mission for autonomously mapping a building and its surroundings.},

abstract = {Distribution of land cover has a profound impact on the climate and environment; mapping the land cover patterns from global, regional to local scales are important for scientists and authorities to yield better monitoring of the changing world. Satellite remote sensing has been demonstrated as an efficient tool to monitor the land cover patterns for a large spatial extent. Nevertheless, the demand on land cover maps at a finer scale (especially in urban areas) has been raised with evidence by numerous biophysical and socio-economic studies. This paper reviews the small-footprint LiDAR sensor - one of the latest high resolution airborne remote sensing technologies, and its application on urban land cover classification. While most of the early researches focus on the analysis of geometric components of 3D LiDAR data point clouds, there has been an increasing interest in investigating the use of intensity data, waveform data and multi-sensor data to facilitate land cover classification and object recognition in urban environment. In this paper, the advancement of airborne LiDAR technology, including data configuration, feature spaces, classification techniques, and radiometric calibration/correction is reviewed and discussed. The review mainly focuses on the LiDAR studies conducted during the last decade with an emphasis on identification of the approach, analysis of pros and cons, investigating the overall accuracy of the technology, and how the classification results can serve as an input for different urban environmental analyses. Finally, several promising directions for future LiDAR research are highlighted, in hope that it will pave the way for the applications of urban environmental modeling and assessment at a finer scale and a greater extent.},

abstract = {Most of the existing robotic exploration schemes use occupancy grid representations and geometric targets known as frontiers. The occupancy grid representation relies on the assumption of independence between grid cells and ignores structural correlations present in the environment. We develop a Gaussian processes (GPs) occupancy mapping technique that is computationally tractable for online map building due to its incremental formulation and provides a continuous model of uncertainty over the map spatial coordinates. The standard way to represent geometric frontiers extracted from occupancy maps is to assign binary values to each grid cell. We extend this notion to novel probabilistic frontier maps computed efficiently using the gradient of the GP occupancy map. We also propose a mutual information-based greedy exploration technique built on that representation that takes into account all possible future observations. A major advantage of high-dimensional map inference is the fact that such techniques require fewer observations, leading to a faster map entropy reduction during exploration for map building scenarios. Evaluations using the publicly available datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed framework for robotic mapping and exploration tasks.},

abstract = {The rapid and accurate assessment of building damage states using only post-event remote sensing data is critical when performing loss estimation in earthquake emergency response. Damaged roof detection is one of the most efficient methods of assessing building damage. In particular, airborne LiDAR is often used to detect roofs damaged by earthquakes, especially for certain damage types, due to its ability to rapidly acquire accurate 3D information on individual roofs. Earthquake-induced roof damages are categorized into surface damages and structural damages based on the geometry features of the debris and the roof structure. However, recent studies have mainly focused on surface damage; little research has been conducted on structural damage. This paper presents an original 3D shape descriptor of individual roofs for detecting roofs with surface damage and roofs exhibiting structural damage by identifying spatial patterns of compact and regular contours for intact roofs, as well as jagged and irregular contours for damaged roofs. The 3D shape descriptor is extracted from building contours derived from airborne LiDAR point clouds. First, contour clusters are extracted from contours that are generated from a dense DSM of individual buildings derived from point clouds. Second, the shape chaos indexes of contour clusters are computed as the information entropy through a contour shape similarity measurement between two contours in a contour cluster. Finally, the 3D shape descriptor is calculated as the weighted sum of the shape chaos index of each contour cluster corresponding to an individual roof. Damaged roofs are detected solely using the 3D shape descriptor with the maximum entropy threshold. Experiments using post-event airborne LiDAR point clouds of the 2010 Haiti earthquake suggest that the proposed damaged roof detection technique using the proposed 3D shape descriptor can detect both roofs exhibiting surface damage and roofs exhibiting structural damage with a high accuracy.},

abstract = {Many geographic processes evolve in a three dimensional space and time continuum. However, when they are represented with the aid of geographic information systems (GIS) or geosimulation models they are modelled in a framework of two-dimensional space with an added temporal component. The objective of this study is to propose the design and implementation of voxel-based automata as a methodological approach for representing spatial processes evolving in the four-dimensional (4D) space–time domain. Similar to geographic automata models which are developed to capture and forecast geospatial processes that change in a two-dimensional spatial framework using cells (raster geospatial data), voxel automata rely on the automata theory and use three-dimensional volumetric units (voxels). Transition rules have been developed to represent various spatial processes which range from the movement of an object in 3D to the diffusion of airborne particles and landslide simulation. In addition, the proposed 4D models demonstrate that complex processes can be readily reproduced from simple transition functions without complex methodological approaches. The voxel-based automata approach provides a unique basis to model geospatial processes in 4D for the purpose of improving representation, analysis and understanding their spatiotemporal dynamics. This study contributes to the advancement of the concepts and framework of 4D GIS.},

For the next level of robot intelligence and intuitive user interaction, maps need to extend beyond geometry and appearance — they need to contain semantics. We address this challenge by combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and a state-of-the-art dense Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM) system, ElasticFusion, which provides long-term dense correspondences between frames of indoor RGB-D video even during loopy scanning trajectories. These correspondences allow the CNN's semantic predictions from multiple view points to be proba-bilistically fused into a map. This not only produces a useful semantic 3D map, but we also show on the NYUv2 dataset that fusing multiple predictions leads to an improvement even in the 2D semantic labelling over baseline single frame predictions. We also show that for a smaller reconstruction dataset with larger variation in prediction viewpoint, the improvement over single frame segmentation increases. Our system is efficient enough to allow real-time interactive use at frame-rates of ≈25Hz.},

These works have questioned the need of features, in which consolidated SLAM techniques of the last decade were based. In this paper we present a novel feature-based monocular SLAM system that is more robust, gives more accurate camera poses, and obtains comparable or better semi-dense reconstructions than the cur- rent state of the art. Our semi-dense mapping operates over keyframes, optimized by local bundle adjustment, allowing to obtain accurate triangulations from wide baselines. Our novel method to search correspondences, the measurement fusion and the inter-keyframe depth consistency tests allow to obtain clean reconstructions with very few outliers. Against the current trend in direct SLAM, our experiments show that by decoupling the semi-dense reconstruction from the trajectory computation, the results obtained are better. This opens the discussion on the benefits of features even if a semi-dense reconstruction is desired.},

abstract = {We address the problem of high speed autonomous navigation of quadrotor micro aerial vehicles with limited onboard sensing and computation. In particular, we propose a dual range planning horizon method to safely and quickly navigate quadrotors to specified goal locations in previously unknown and unstructured environments. In each planning epoch, a short-range planner uses a local map to generate a new trajectory. At the same time, a safe stopping policy is found. This allows the robot to come to an emergency halt when necessary. Our algorithm guarantees collision avoidance and demonstrates important advances in real-time planning. First, our novel short range planning method allows us to generate and re-plan trajectories that are dynamically feasible, comply with state and input constraints, and avoid obstacles in real-time. Further, previous planning algorithms abstract away the obstacle detection problem by assuming the instantaneous availability of geometric information about the environment. In contrast, our method addresses the challenge of using the raw sensor data to form a map and navigate in real-time. Finally, in addition to simulation examples, we provide physical experiments that demonstrate the entire algorithmic pipeline from obstacle detection to trajectory execution.},

abstract = {Remote Sensing technologies are capable of providing high-resolution spatial data needed to set up advanced flood simulation models. Amongst them, aerial Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) surveys or Airborne Laser Scanner (ALS) systems have long been used to provide digital topographic maps. Nowadays, Remote Sensing data are commonly used to create Digital Terrain Models (DTMs) for detailed urban-flood modelling. However, the difficulty of relying on top-view LiDAR data only is that it cannot detect whether passages for floodwaters are hidden underneath vegetated areas or beneath overarching structures such as roads, railroads, and bridges. Such (hidden) small urban features can play an important role in urban flood propagation. In this paper, a complex urban area of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia was chosen as a study area to simulate the extreme flooding event that occurred in 2003. Three different DTMs were generated and used as input for a two-dimensional (2D) urban flood model. A top-view LiDAR approach was used to create two DTMs: (i) a standard LiDAR-DTM and (ii) a Filtered LiDAR-DTM taking into account specific ground-view features. In addition, a Structure from Motion (SfM) approach was used to detect hidden urban features from a sequence of ground-view images; these ground-view SfM data were then combined with top-view Filtered LiDAR data to create (iii) a novel Multidimensional Fusion of Views-Digital Terrain Model (MFV-DTM). These DTMs were then used as a basis for the 2D urban flood model. The resulting dynamic flood maps are compared with observations at six measurement locations. It was found that when applying only top-view DTMs as input data, the flood simulation results appear to have mismatches in both floodwater depths and flood propagation patterns. In contrast, when employing the top-ground-view fusion approach (MFV-DTM), the results not only show a good agreement in floodwater depth, but also simulate more correctly the floodwater dynamics around small urban feature. Overall, the new multi-view approach of combining top-view LiDAR data with ground-view SfM observations shows a good potential for creating an accurate digital terrain map which can be then used as an input for a numerical urban flood model.},

In special, the problem of mapping complex environments, with features changing from tree-lined streets to urban areas with dense traffic, is studied. The robotic car is equipped with an odometry sensor, a 3D LiDAR Velodyne HDL-32E, a IMU, and a low cost GPS, and the data generated by these sensors are integrated in a pose-based GraphSLAM estimator. A new strategy for identification and correction of odometry data using evolutionary algorithms is presented. This new strategy makes odometry data significantly more consistent with GPS. Loop closures are detected using GPS data, and GICP, a 3D point cloud registration algorithm, is used to estimate the displacement between the different travels over the same region. After path estimation, 3D LiDAR data is used to build an occupancy grid mapping of the environment. A detailed mathematical description of how occupancy evidence can be calculated from the point clouds is given, and a submapping strategy to handle memory limitations is presented as well. The proposed framework is tested in three real world environments with different sizes, and features: a parking lot, a university beltway, and a city neighborhood. In all cases, satisfactory maps were built, with precise loop closures even when the vehicle traveled long distances between them.},

The technique exploits the continuous property of GPs and, as a result, the map can be inferred with any resolution. In addition, the proposed GP Semantic Map (GPSM) learns the structural and semantic correlation from measurements rather than resorting to assumptions, and can flexibly learn the spatial correlation as well as any additional non-spatial correlation between map points. We extend the OctoMap to Semantic OctoMap representation and compare with the GPSM mapping performance using NYU Depth V2 dataset. Evaluations of the proposed technique on multiple partially labeled RGBD scans and labels from noisy image segmentation show that the GP semantic map can handle sparse measurements, missing labels in the point cloud, as well as noise corrupted labels.},

abstract = {A critical problem in mapping data is the frequent updating of large data sets. To solve this problem, the updating of small-scale data based on large-scale data is very effective. Various map generalization techniques, such as simplification, displacement, typification, elimination, and aggregation, must therefore be applied. In this study, we focused on the elimination and aggregation of the building layer, for which each building in a large scale was classified as “0-eliminated,” “1-retained,” or “2-aggregated.” Machine-learning classification algorithms were then used for classifying the buildings. The data of 1:1000 scale and 1:25,000 scale digital maps obtained from the National Geographic Information Institute were used. We applied to these data various machine-learning classification algorithms, including naive Bayes (NB), decision tree (DT), k-nearest neighbor (k-NN), and support vector machine (SVM). The overall accuracies of each algorithm were satisfactory: DT, 88.96{\%}; k-NN, 88.27{\%}; SVM, 87.57{\%}; and NB, 79.50{\%}. Although elimination is a direct part of the proposed process, generalization operations, such as simplification and aggregation of polygons, must still be performed for buildings classified as retained and aggregated. Thus, these algorithms can be used for building classification and can serve as preparatory steps for building generalization.},

abstract = {There are now a wide range of techniques that can be combined for image analysis. These include the use of object-based classifications rather than pixel-based classifiers, the use of LiDAR to determine vegetation height and vertical structure, as well terrain variables such as topographic wetness index and slope that can be calculated using GIS. This research investigates the benefits of combining these techniques to identify individual tree species. A QuickBird image and low point density LiDAR data for a coastal region in New Zealand was used to examine the possibility of mapping Pohutukawa trees which are regarded as an iconic tree in New Zealand. The study area included a mix of buildings and vegetation types. After image and LiDAR preparation, single tree objects were identified using a range of techniques including: a threshold of above ground height to eliminate ground based objects; Normalised Difference Vegetation Index and elevation difference between the first and last return of LiDAR data to distinguish vegetation from buildings; geometric information to separate clusters of trees from single trees, and treetop identification and region growing techniques to separate tree clusters into single tree crowns. Important feature variables were identified using Random Forest, and the Support Vector Machine provided the classification. The combined techniques using LiDAR and spectral data produced an overall accuracy of 85.4{\%} (Kappa 80.6{\%}). Classification using just the spectral data produced an overall accuracy of 75.8{\%} (Kappa 67.8{\%}). The research findings demonstrate how the combining of LiDAR and spectral data improves classification for Pohutukawa trees.},

A hierarchy of navigation strategies is outlined in the discussion, together with the sort of adaptive capacities each affords to cope with unexpected obstacles or dangers encountered on an animat or robot's way to its goal. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to analyze and discuss the performance and stability of a tailless micro aerial vehicle with flexible articulated wings. The dihedral angles can be varied symmetrically on both wings to control the aircraft speed independently of the angle of attack and flight-path angle, while an asymmetric dihedral setting can be used to control yaw in the absence of a vertical tail.Anonlinear aeroelastic model is derived, and it is used to study the steadystate performance and flight stability of the micro aerial vehicle. The concept of the effective dihedral is introduced, which allows for a unified treatment of rigid and flexible wing aircraft. It also identifies the amount of elasticity that is necessary to obtain tangible performance benefits over a rigid wing. The feasibility of using axial tension to stiffen the wing is discussed, and, at least in the context of a linear model, it is shown that adding axial tension is effective but undesirable. The turning performance of an micro aerial vehicle with flexible wings is compared to an otherwise identical micro aerial vehicle with rigid wings. The wing dihedral alone can be varied asymmetrically to perform rapid turns and regulate sideslip. The maximum attainable turn rate for a given elevator setting, however, does not increase unless antisymmetric wing twisting is employed. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2011.},

abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of motion planning for fast, agile flight through a dense obstacle field. A key contribution is the design of two families of motion primitives for aerial robots flying in dense obstacle fields, along with rules to stitch them together. The primitives are obtained by solving for the flight dynamics of the aerial robot, and explicitly account for limited agility using time delays. The first family of primitives consists of turning maneuvers to link any two points in space. The locations of the terminal points are used to obtain closed-form expressions for the control inputs required to fly between them, while accounting for the finite time required to switch between consecutive sets of control inputs. The second family consists of aggressive turn-around maneuvers wherein the time delay between the angle of attack and roll angle commands is used to optimize the maneuver for the spatial constraints. A 3-D motion planning algorithm based on these primitives is presented for aircraft flying through a dense forest.},

abstract = {More than a million insects and approximately 11,000 vertebrates utilize flapping wings to fly. However, flapping flight has only been studied in a few of these species, so many challenges remain in understanding this form of locomotion. Five key aerodynamic mechanisms have been identified for insect flight. Among these is the leading edge vortex, which is a convergent solution to avoid stall for insects, bats and birds. The roles of the other mechanisms - added mass, clap and fling, rotational circulation and wing-wake interactions - have not yet been thoroughly studied in the context of vertebrate flight. Further challenges to understanding bat and bird flight are posed by the complex, dynamic wing morphologies of these species and the more turbulent airflow generated by their wings compared with that observed during insect flight. Nevertheless, three dimensionless numbers that combine key flow, morphological and kinematic parameters - the Reynolds number, Rossby number and advance ratio - govern flapping wing aerodynamics for both insects and vertebrates. These numbers can thus be used to organize an integrative framework for studying and comparing animal flapping flight. Here, we provide a roadmap for developing such a framework, highlighting the aerodynamic mechanisms that remain to be quantified and compared across species. Ultimately, incorporating complex flight maneuvers, environmental effects and developmental stages into this framework will also be essential to advancing our understanding of the biomechanics, movement ecology and evolution of animal flight.},

We here proffer an analysis based on kinematic theory and experimental visualization of the flow to complete a treatment of the aerodynamic force affecting a hovering flyer that generates a lift force approximately equal to its weight, and remains nearly stationary in midair; the center and direction of the aerodynamic force are accordingly determined with some assumptions made. The principal condition to resolve the problem is the stabilization of the vision of a flyer, which is inspired by a hovering passerine that experiences a substantial upward swing during downstroke periods while its eye remains stabilized. Viewing the aerodynamic force with a bird's eye, we find that the center and direction of this aerodynamic force vary continuously with respect to the lift force. Our results provide practical guidance for engineers to enhance the visual stability of surveillance cameras incorporated in micro aerial vehicles.},

Preceding authors focused mainly on the bird's wings, generally neglecting the bird's body; we discuss specifically the distinction of the aerodynamic effect between cases with and without the presence of the bird's body. The results of simulation show that, considering only two wings, for a distance between the wing model and the ground smaller than a semi-span, the smaller is the ground clearance, the more significant is the ground effect. At clearance 0.37 times a semi-span, the drag is decreased 11{\%}, and the lift is increased 5.6{\%}. The ground effect for an intact bird model composed of both wings and body is less effective than that for a simplified model with body omitted, because a suction was observed on the lower surface of the intact bird's trunk at clearance 0.37 times a semi-span; for this reason the intact bird model benefits less from the ground effect than the model with body excluded, but increased lift and decreased drag remain observable.

In contrast, the wings of a bird can be reshaped to provide optimal performance at all flight conditions.

Morphing technologies offer aerodynamic benefits for an aircraft over a wide range of flight condi-tions. The advantages of a morphing aircraft are based on an assumption that the additional weight of the morphing com-ponents is acceptable. Traditional mechanical and hydraulic systems are not considered good choices for morphing aircraft. ''Smart'' materials and structures have the advantages of high energy density, ease of control, variable stiffness, and the ability to tolerate large amounts of strain. These characteristics offer researchers and designers new possibilities for designing morphing aircraft.

All image analysis and processing necessary for deriving and controlling the flight trajectory take place off-board on a system external to the MAV. This permits the use of sophisticated multithreaded real-time algorithms that do not limit the speed of the drone. Furthermore, due to the elimination of on-board processing and possibly the use of additional sensors for realizing such autonomy, stock drones can be used and flight times realized on a single charge remain unaffected. We describe a prototype implementation on a Parrot AR.Drone quadcopter and initial results for autonomous navigation in a structured indoor environment that establishes the viability of the approach.},

abstract = {Competing hypotheses about evolutionary origins of flight are the ‘fundamental wing-stroke' and ‘directed aerial descent' hypotheses. Support for the fundamental wing-stroke hypothesis is that extant birds use flapping of their wings to climb even before they are able to fly; there are no reported examples of incrementally increasing use of wing movements in gliding transitioning to flapping. An open question is whether locomotor styles must evolve initially for efficiency or if they might instead arrive due to efficacy. The proximal muscles of the avian wing output work and power for flight, and new research is exploring functions of the distal muscles in relation to dynamic changes in wing shape. It will be useful to test the relative contributions of the muscles of the forearm compared with inertial and aerodynamic loading of the wing upon dynamic morphing. Body size has dramatic effects upon flight performance. New research has revealed that mass-specific muscle power declines with increasing body mass among species. This explains the constraints associated with being large. Hummingbirds are the only species that can sustain hovering. Their ability to generate force, work and power appears to be limited by time for activation and deactivation within their wingbeats of high frequency. Most small birds use flap-bounding flight, and this flight style may offer an energetic advantage over continuous flapping during fast flight or during flight into a headwind. The use of flap-bounding during slow flight remains enigmatic. Flap-bounding birds do not appear to be constrained to use their primary flight muscles in a fixed manner. To improve understanding of the functional significance of flap-bounding, the energetic costs and the relative use of alternative styles by a given species in nature merit study. This article is part of the themed issue ‘Moving in a moving medium: new perspectives on flight'.},

abstract = {Swifts are among the most aerodynamically refined gliding birds. However, the overlapping vanes and protruding shafts of their primary feathers make swift wings remarkably rough for their size. Wing roughness height is 1-2{\%} of chord length on the upper surface-10,000 times rougher than sailplane wings. Sailplanes depend on extreme wing smoothness to increase the area of laminar flow on the wing surface and minimize drag for extended glides. To understand why the swift does not rely on smooth wings, we used a stethoscope to map laminar flow over preserved wings in a low-turbulence wind tunnel. By combining laminar area, lift, and drag measurements, we show that average area of laminar flow on swift wings is 69{\%} (n = 3; std 13{\%}) of their total area during glides that maximize flight distance and duration-similar to high-performance sailplanes. Our aerodynamic analysis indicates that swifts attain laminar flow over their rough wings because their wing size is comparable to the distance the air travels (after a roughness-induced perturbation) before it transitions from laminar to turbulent. To interpret the function of swift wing roughness, we simulated its effect on smooth model wings using physical models. This manipulation shows that laminar flow is reduced and drag increased at high speeds. At the speeds at which swifts cruise, however, swift-like roughness prolongs laminar flow and reduces drag. This feature gives small birds with rudimentary wings an edge during the evolution of glide performance.},

A unique feature of this robot is that it uses wing articulation to control the flight path angle as well as the heading angle. It lacks a vertical tail for improved agility, which results in unstable lateral-directional dynamics. New closed-loop motion planning algorithms with guaranteed stability are obtained by rewriting the flight dynamic equations in the spatial domain rather than as functions of time, after which dynamic inversion is employed. It is shown that nonlinear dynamic inversion naturally leads to proportional-integral-derivative controllers, thereby providing an exact method for tuning the gains. The capabilities of the proposed bioinspired robot design and its novel closed-loop perching controller have been successfully demonstrated with perched landings on a human hand.},

abstract = {Mosquitoes exhibit unusual wing kinematics; their long, slender wings flap at remarkably high frequencies for their size ({\textgreater}800 Hz)and with lower stroke amplitudes than any other insect group. This shifts weight support away from the translation-dominated, aerodynamic mechanisms used by most insects, as well as by helicopters and aeroplanes, towards poorly understood rotational mechanisms that occur when pitching at the end of each half-stroke. Here we report free-flight mosquito wing kinematics, solve the full Navier-Stokes equations using computational fluid dynamics with overset grids, and validate our results with in vivo flow measurements. We show that, although mosquitoes use familiar separated flow patterns, much of the aerodynamic force that supports their weight is generated in a manner unlike any previously described for a flying animal. There are three key features: leading-edge vortices (a well-known mechanism that appears to be almost ubiquitous in insect flight), trailing-edge vortices caused by a form of wake capture at stroke reversal, and rotational drag. The two new elements are largely independent of the wing velocity, instead relying on rapid changes in the pitch angle (wing rotation) at the end of each half-stroke, and they are therefore relatively immune to the shallow flapping amplitude. Moreover, these mechanisms are particularly well suited to high aspect ratio mosquito wings.},

A specific type of turning maneuver, termed a 'hovering turn', was experimentally identified, which is evidently distinct from the yaw or bank turn that is well documented in the literature. The hovering turn is characterized by a turning radius only about {\~{}}1/10 of the wingspan, and requires less than 0. 2 s. The reorientation of the bird's body is invariably preceded by a brief hovering stage during which the elevation angle of the bird increases from 40° to approximately 90°, leading beneficially to a considerable decrease (40{\%} of its maximum) in the moment of inertia of the body against the axis of rotation. The brief hovering is deemed a strategic, preparatory and transitional stage in executing a roll-dominated turn that is efficient and particularly suitable for a small space. The mechanisms pertaining to the hovering turn might provide a useful, biomechanical inspiration to improve the maneuverability of artificial aerial vehicles. {\textcopyright} 2011 Society for Experimental Mechanics.},

Much of the research on tendon-driven Stewart platforms is devoted either to the completely restrained positioning mechanism (CRPM) or to one particular type of the incompletely restrained positioning mechanism (IRPM) where the external force is provided by the gravitational pull on the platform such as in cable-suspended Stewart platforms. An IRPM-based platform is proposed which uses the external force provided by a compliant member. The compliant central column allows the configuration to achieve n DOFs with n tendons. In particular, this investigation focuses on the angular deflection of the upper platform with respect to the lower platform. The application here is aimed at developing a linkable module that can be connected to one another so as to form a "snake robot" of sorts. Since locomotion takes precedence over positioning in this application, a 3-DOF Stewart platform is adopted.

The tunnel was tilted to simulate descending flight at different sink speeds. The swift varied its wingspan, wing area and tail span over the speed range. Wingspan decreased linearly with speed, whereas tail span decreased in a nonlinear manner. For each airspeed, the minimum glide angle was found. The corresponding sink speeds showed a curvilinear relationship with airspeed, with a minimum sink speed at 8.1 m s(-1) and a speed of best glide at 9.4 m s(-1). Lift-to-drag ratio was calculated for each airspeed and tilt angle combinations and the maximum for each speed showed a curvilinear relationship with airspeed, with a maximum of 12.5 at an airspeed of 9.5 m s(-1). Wake was sampled in the transverse plane using stereo digital particle image velocimetry (DPIV). The main structures of the wake were a pair of trailing wingtip vortices and a pair of trailing tail vortices. Circulation of these was measured and a model was constructed that showed good weight support. Parasite drag was estimated from the wake defect measured in the wake behind the body. Parasite drag coefficient ranged from 0.30 to 0.22 over the range of airspeeds. Induced drag was calculated and used to estimate profile drag coefficient, which was found to be in the same range as that previously measured on a Harris' hawk.},

We find that the wings unfold passively within one to two flaps and remain unfolded with only small amplitude oscillations. To better understand the passive dynamics, we constructed a computer model of the unfolding process based on rigid body dynamics, contact models, and aerodynamic correlations. This model predicts the measured passive unfolding within about one flap and shows that unfolding is driven by centrifugal acceleration induced by flapping. The simulations also predict that relative unfolding time only weakly depends on flapping frequency and can be reduced to less than half a wingbeat by increasing flapping amplitude. Subsequent dimensional analysis shows that the time required to unfold passively is of the same order of magnitude as the flapping period. This suggests that centrifugal acceleration can drive passive unfolding within approximately one wingbeat in small and large wings. Finally, we show experimentally that passive unfolding wings can withstand impact with a branch, by first folding and then unfolding passively. This mechanism enables flapping robots to squeeze through clutter without sophisticated control. Passive unfolding also provides a new avenue in morphing wing design that makes future flapping morphing wings possibly more energy efficient and light-weight. Simultaneously these results point to possible inertia driven, and therefore metabolically efficient, control strategies in bats and birds to morph or recover within a beat.},

We fuse all of the depth data streamed from a Kinect sensor into a single global implicit surface model of the observed scene in real-time. The current sensor pose is simultaneously obtained by tracking the live depth frame relative to the global model using a coarse-to-fine iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm, which uses all of the observed depth data available. We demonstrate the advantages of tracking against the growing full surface model compared with frame-to-frame tracking, obtaining tracking and mapping results in constant time within room sized scenes with limited drift and high accuracy. We also show both qualitative and quantitative results relating to various aspects of our tracking and mapping system. Modelling of natural scenes, in real-time with only commodity sensor and GPU hardware, promises an exciting step forward in augmented reality (AR), in particular, it allows dense surfaces to be reconstructed in real-time, with a level of detail and robustness beyond any solution yet presented using passive computer vision.},

In particular, we analyse the pitching and plunging dynamics for two cases: a two-dimensional flat plate at {\$}\backslashmathit{\{}Re{\}}= 100{\$} using high-fidelity direct numerical simulations and a three-dimensional NACA 0006 aerofoil at {\$}\backslashmathit{\{}Re{\}}= 65\backslashhspace{\{}0.167em{\}} 000{\$} using wind-tunnel measurements. Models are obtained at various angles of attack and they are verified against measurements using frequency response plots and large-amplitude manoeuvres. These models provide a low-dimensional balanced representation of the relevant unsteady fluid dynamics. In simulations, flow structures are visualized using finite-time Lyapunov exponents. A number of phenomenological trends are observed, both in the data and in the models. As the base angle of attack increases, the boundary layer begins to separate, resulting in a decreased quasi-steady lift coefficient slope and a delayed relaxation to steady state at low frequencies. This extends the low-frequency range of motions that excite unsteady effects, meaning that the quasi-steady approximation is not valid until lower frequencies than are predicted by Theodorsen's classical inviscid model. In addition, at small angles of attack, the lift coefficient rises to the steady-state value after a step in angle, while at larger angles of attack, the lift coefficient relaxes down to the steady-state after an initially high lift state. Flow visualization indicates that this coincides with the formation and convection of vortices at the leading edge and trailing edge. As the angle of attack approaches the critical angle for vortex shedding, the poles and zeros of the model approach the imaginary axis in the complex plane, and some zeros cross into the right half plane. This has significant implications for active flow control, which are discussed. These trends are observed in both simulations and wind-tunnel data.},

abstract = {Many flying animals use both flapping and gliding flight as part of their routine behaviour. These two kinematic patterns impose conflicting requirements on wing design for aerodynamic efficiency and, in the absence of extreme morphing, wings cannot be optimised for both flight modes. In gliding flight, the wing experiences uniform incident flow and the optimal shape is a high aspect ratio wing with an elliptical planform. In flapping flight, on the other hand, the wing tip travels faster than the root, creating a spanwise velocity gradient. To compensate, the optimal wing shape should taper towards the tip (reducing the local chord) and/or twist from root to tip (reducing local angle of attack). We hypothesised that, if a bird is limited in its ability to morph its wings and adapt its wing shape to suit both flight modes, then a preference towards flapping flight optimization will be expected since this is the most energetically demanding flight mode. We tested this by studying a well-known flap-gliding species, the common swift, by measuring the wakes generated by two birds, one in gliding and one in flapping flight in a wind tunnel. We calculated span efficiency, the efficiency of lift production, and found that the flapping swift had consistently higher span efficiency than the gliding swift. This supports our hypothesis and suggests that even though swifts have been shown previously to increase their lift-to-drag ratio substantially when gliding, the wing morphology is tuned to be more aerodynamically efficient in generating lift during flapping. Since body drag can be assumed to be similar for both flapping and gliding, it follows that the higher total drag in flapping flight compared with gliding flight is primarily a consequence of an increase in wing profile drag due to the flapping motion, exceeding the reduction in induced drag.},

A key contribution is the design of two families of motion primitives for aerial robots flying in dense obstacle fields, along with rules to stitch them together. The primitives are obtained by solving for the flight dynamics of the aerial robot, and explicitly account for limited agility using time delays. The first family of primitives consists of turning maneuvers to link any two points in space. The locations of the terminal points are used to obtain closed-form expressions for the control inputs required to fly between them, while accounting for the finite time required to switch between consecutive sets of control inputs. The second family consists of aggressive turn-around maneuvers wherein the time delay between the angle of attack and roll angle commands is used to optimize the maneuver for the spatial constraints. A 3-D motion planning algorithm based on these primitives is presented for aircraft flying through a dense forest.},

abstract = {Gliding birds continually change the shape and size of their wings, presumably to exploit the profound effect of wing morphology on aerodynamic performance. That birds should adjust wing sweep to suit glide speed has been predicted qualitatively by analytical glide models, which extrapolated the wing's performance envelope from aerodynamic theory. Here we describe the aerodynamic and structural performance of actual swift wings, as measured in a wind tunnel, and on this basis build a semi-empirical glide model. By measuring inside and outside swifts' behavioural envelope, we show that choosing the most suitable sweep can halve sink speed or triple turning rate. Extended wings are superior for slow glides and turns; swept wings are superior for fast glides and turns. This superiority is due to better aerodynamic performance-with the exception of fast turns. Swept wings are less effective at generating lift while turning at high speeds, but can bear the extreme loads. Finally, our glide model predicts that cost-effective gliding occurs at speeds of 8-10 m s(-1), whereas agility-related figures of merit peak at 15-25 m s(-1). In fact, swifts spend the night ('roost') in flight at 8-10 m s(-1) (ref. 11), thus our model can explain this choice for a resting behaviour. Morphing not only adjusts birds' wing performance to the task at hand, but could also control the flight of future aircraft.},

abstract = {Inspired by birds flying through cluttered environments such as dense forests, this paper studies the theoretical foundations of a novel motion planning problem: high-speed navigation through a randomly-generated obstacle field when only the statistics of the obstacle generating process are known a priori. Resembling a planar forest environment, the obstacle generating process is assumed to determine the locations and sizes of disk-shaped obstacles. When this process is ergodic, and under mild technical conditions on the dynamics of the bird, it is shown that the existence of an infinite collision-free trajectory through the forest exhibits a phase transition. On one hand, if the bird flies faster than a certain critical speed, then, with probability one, there is no infinite collision-free trajectory, i.e., the bird will eventually collide with some tree, almost surely, regardless of the planning algorithm governing the bird's motion. On the other hand, if the bird flies slower than this critical speed, then there exists at least one infinite collision-free trajectory, almost surely. Lower and upper bounds on the critical speed are derived for the special case of a homogeneous Poisson forest considering a simple model for the bird's dynamics. For the same case, an equivalent percolation model is provided. Using this model, the phase diagram is approximated in Monte-Carlo simulations. This paper also establishes novel connections between robot motion planning and statistical physics through ergodic theory and percolation theory, which may be of independent interest.},

It is assumed to function similarly to a leading-edge slat that increases lift and delays stall. However, in spite of its universal presence in flying birds and the wide acceptance of stall delay as its main function, how the alula delays the stall and aids the flight of birds remains unclear. Here, we investigated the function of alula on the aerodynamic performance of avian wings based on data from flight tasks and wind-tunnel experiments. With the alula, the birds performed steeper descending flights with greater changes in body orientation. Force measurements revealed that the alula increases the lift and often delays the stall. Digital particle image velocimetry showed that these effects are caused by the streamwise vortex, formed at the tip of the alula, that induces strong downwash and suppresses the flow separation over the wing surface. This is the first experimental evidence that the alula functions as a vortex generator that increases the lift force and enhances manoeuvrability in flights at high angles of attack.},

In this article, we evaluate vision algorithms as alternatives for detection and distance estimation of mUAVs, since other sensing modalities entail certain limitations on the environment or on the distance. For this purpose, we test Haar-like features, histogram of gradients (HOG) and local binary patterns (LBP) using cascades of boosted classifiers. Cascaded boosted classifiers allow fast processing by performing detection tests at multiple stages, where only candidates passing earlier simple stages are processed at the preceding more complex stages. We also integrate a distance estimation method with our system utilizing geometric cues with support vector regressors. We evaluated each method on indoor and outdoor videos that are collected in a systematic way and also on videos having motion blur. Our experiments show that, using boosted cascaded classifiers with LBP, near real-time detection and distance estimation of mUAVs are possible in about 60 ms indoors (1032 × 778 resolution) and 150 ms outdoors (1280 × 720 resolution) per frame, with a detection rate of 0.96 F-score. However, the cascaded classifiers using Haar-like features lead to better distance estimation since they can position the bounding boxes on mUAVs more accurately. On the other hand, our time analysis yields that the cascaded classifiers using HOG train and run faster than the other algorithms.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016. Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd.Birds morph their wings during a single wingbeat, across flight speeds and among flight modes. Such morphing may allow them to maximize aerodynamic performance, but this assumption remains largely untested. We tested the aerodynamic performance of swept and extended wing postures of 13 raptor species in three families (Accipitridae, Falconidae and Strigidae) using a propeller model to emulate mid-downstroke of flapping during take-off and a wind tunnel to emulate gliding. Based on previous research, we hypothesized that (1) during flapping, wing posture would not affect maximum ratios of vertical and horizontal force coefficients (CV:CH), and that (2) extended wings would have higher maximum CV:CH when gliding. Contrary to each hypothesis, during flapping, extended wings had, on average, 31{\%} higher maximum CV:CHratios and 23{\%} higher CV than swept wings across all biologically relevant attack angles ($\alpha$), and, during gliding, maximum CV:CH ratios were similar for the two postures. Swept wings had 11{\%} higher CV than extended wings in gliding flight, suggesting flow conditions around these flexed raptor wings may be different from those in previous studies of swifts (Apodidae). Phylogenetic affiliation was a poor predictor of wing performance, due in part to high intrafamilial variation. Mass was only significantly correlated with extended wing performance during gliding. We conclude that wing shape has a greater effect on force per unit wing area during flapping at low advance ratio, such as takeoff, than during gliding.},

abstract = {How predators search for prey is a cornerstone question in behavioural ecology, which has yet to be investigated for animals foraging in 3D airspace. Do insectivorous birds such as swifts (Apodidae), swallows and martins (Hirundinidae) use similar strategies to those performed by terrestrial predators in 2D, or do they rely on different spatial search strategies because of some properties of the aerial open space? We addressed this question in the common swift, one of the most aerial birds, using a novel 3D optical tracking method. The analysis of fine-scale flight tracks revealed how birds distribute their presence in 3D space while foraging near their breeding colony. Common swifts concentrated the time spent per volume unit by adopting a tortuous path, and, to a much lesser extent, by decreasing their movement speed. By independently observing the birds' posture on tracking images, we were able to identify the occurrence of putative prey captures along flight tracks. We show that swifts' presence was concentrated mainly in the vicinity of prey captures, unveiling a volume-concentrated search (VCS) strategy in this aerial insectivore. This is an extension in 3D of the area-concentrated search classically described in terrestrial 2D space. VCS can (but does not necessarily) take place in thermal updrafts, where small insects can be concentrated in patches. In contrast to terrestrial and aquatic predators that can easily slow down or stop their movement in profitable places, a different speed–cost relationship underlying aerial movement prevents swifts from stopping in prey patches and explains why these birds rely mainly on movement tortuosity to perform intensive search. Our study thus shows how some physical properties of the environment can modulate the way an animal concentrates its search in profitable places.},

@article{Paranjape2013b,
abstract = {We describe the design of an aerial robot inspired by birds and the underlying theoretical developments leading to novel control and closed-loop guidance algorithms for a perching maneuver. A unique feature of this robot is that it uses wing articulation to control the flight path angle as well as the heading angle. It lacks a vertical tail for improved agility, which results in unstable lateral-directional dynamics. New closed-loop motion planning algorithms with guaranteed stability are obtained by rewriting the flight dynamic equations in the spatial domain rather than as functions of time, after which dynamic inversion is employed. It is shown that nonlinear dynamic inversion naturally leads to proportional-integral-derivative controllers, thereby providing an exact method for tuning the gains. The capabilities of the proposed bioinspired robot design and its novel closed-loop perching controller have been successfully demonstrated with perched landings on a human hand.},
