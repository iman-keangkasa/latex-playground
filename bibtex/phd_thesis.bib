abstract = {RatSLAM is a navigation system based on the neural processes underlying navigation in the rodent brain, capable of operating with low resolution monocular image data. Seminal experiments using RatSLAM include mapping an entire suburb with a web camera and a long term robot delivery trial. This paper describes OpenRatSLAM, an open-source version of RatSLAM with bindings to the Robot Operating System framework to leverage advantages such as robot and sensor abstraction, networking, data playback, and visualization. OpenRatSLAM comprises connected ROS nodes to represent RatSLAM's pose cells, experience map, and local view cells, as well as a fourth node that provides visual odometry estimates. The nodes are described with reference to the RatSLAM model and salient details of the ROS implementation such as topics, messages, parameters, class diagrams, sequence diagrams, and parameter tuning strategies. The performance of the system is demonstrated on three publicly available open-source datasets. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract = {This study attempts to present a new and comprehensive cycle for the design of fixed wing micro air vehicles. The idea is to propose a complete cycle containing all micro air vehicles design subjects such as aerodynamics, stability, structure, and navigation. The main aim of the cycle is to decrease the designing time for an optimum design. In this method, the sizing process is started simultaneously, which involves the following cases: specification of mission and aviation plan; determination of planform and aspect ratio; constraint analysis; estimation of plane weight. Completion of these four phases results in the specification of the geometry and dimensions of the wing in an optimum manner. After determination of the planform geometry, selection of the airfoil is carried out by complying with the defined criteria. After this stage, the wing of micro air vehicle is designed completely and analysis is carried out to determine the aerodynamics coefficients. Next step is designing the fuselage for the airplane. Then micro air vehicle and aerodynamic center of wing are calculated and stability equations for micro air vehicle are simulated. The results of these processes are determination of surfaces, dimensions and airfoils of the tails and center of gravity of the plane. After calculation of the control surfaces, the designed micro air vehicle is analyzed in XFLR5 software. Next step is selection of electric equipment such as motor, batteries, servo, etc. The final step of design is the optimization of the micro air vehicle for increasing its performance and endurance. After the design, steps of manufacturing will be started.$\backslash$r$\backslash$n},

abstract = {We propose a direct (feature-less) monocular SLAM algorithm which, in contrast to current state-of-the-art regarding direct meth- ods, allows to build large-scale, consistent maps of the environment. Along with highly accurate pose estimation based on direct image alignment, the 3D environment is reconstructed in real-time as pose-graph of keyframes with associated semi-dense depth maps. These are obtained by filtering over a large number of pixelwise small-baseline stereo comparisons. The explicitly scale-drift aware formulation allows the approach to operate on challenging sequences including large variations in scene scale. Major enablers are two key novelties: (1) a novel direct tracking method which operates on sim(3), thereby explicitly detecting scale-drift, and (2) an elegant probabilistic solution to include the effect of noisy depth values into tracking. The resulting direct monocular SLAM system runs in real-time on a CPU.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT In recent years, commercially available mobile robots, that operate in indoor environments, have found their ways into private homes, office environments, and industrial settings. They fulfill important duties such as transportation, telepresence, and cleaning. While some tasks, such as vacuum cleaning, can be achieved with rudimentary perception, for more complex tasks sophisticated perception capabilities are fundamental for autonomous robots. Even for the mentioned vacuum cleaning, improved perception allows for substantial increases in efficiency. In this thesis, we investigate novel approaches for the modelling of indoor environments for robot navigation. Being an important foundation for higher level skills, a particular focus lies on simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), which allows a robot to construct a model of its environment during operation. In the context of SLAM, we develop an approach for RGB-D cameras, that captures dense 3D maps for robot navigation. For this SLAM system, we propose novel methods to increase the accuracy of the trajectory estimation and the robustness against misassociations during individual motion estimates. Further, we address a major limitation on the hardware side of RGB-D cameras, namely the limited field of view. We investigate SLAM with multiple RGB-D cameras and develop an approach for automated extrinsic calibration of RGB-D cameras via SLAM. We further propose an extension of RGB-D sensors with mirrors to bisect the field of view into two roughly opposite views. While this does not increase the overall information perceived, we show that the divided field of view is beneficial in the context of SLAM. Additionally, we exploit the structural properties of this catadioptric extension to constrain the mentioned calibration method, such that planar motion of the robot is sufficient for online calibration of the two views. To autonomously access all areas in a private home or office, a further key skill for robot navigation is the operation of doors. In this context, we extend the state of the art by novel methods for learning a model of the kinematics and dynamics of a door. We demonstrate that the knowledge about the dynamics of a door allows the robot to accurately predict the motion of the door from inertia. We use this ability to employ a door opening strategy with low requirements on the dexterous workspace of the manipulator. To show the benefits of the approaches proposed in this thesis, we thoroughly evaluate them in experiments with real robots and real sensor data. Overall, the proposed approaches lower the cost of the sensing equipment and the required complexity of the manipulator. These factors are particular important for commercial robots targeted at households and small businesses.},

abstract = {This paper presents a method of estimating camera pose in an unknown scene. While this has previously been attempted by adapting SLAM algorithms developed for robotic exploration, we propose a system specifically designed to track a hand-held camera in a small AR workspace. We propose to split tracking and mapping into two separate tasks, processed in parallel threads on a dual-core computer: one thread deals with the task of robustly tracking erratic hand-held motion, while the other produces a 3D map of point features from previously observed video frames. This allows the use of computationally expensive batch optimisation techniques not usually associated with real-time operation: The result is a system that produces detailed maps with thousands of landmarks which can be tracked at frame-rate, with an accuracy and robustness rivalling that of state-of-the-art model-based systems.},

abstract = {Depression is a commonly occurring mental disorder, which is characterized by dysfunctional inhibition and facilitation for emotional stimuli. The aim of the present study was to investigate distracter inhibition and facilitation for emotional faces in depressed individuals in a negative affective priming task. Control participants who had never suffered from depression (NC), sub-clinically depressed participants, and participants diagnosed with a current major depressive disorder (MDD), Anxiety Inventory, the Hamilton Depression Rating Score were recruited using the Beck Depression Inventory, the Beck and DSM-IV as tools. Twenty-four participants in each group completed a negative affective priming task. The main finding was that there were no significant differences among the three groups in the positive and negative priming effects of happy faces. However, there were significant differences for positive and negative priming effects of sad faces between each pair of groups, with the effects being lowest for MDD and highest for NC participants. It can be concluded that depressed individuals are characterized by enhanced facilitation and deficient inhibition for negative materials, which is a stable cognitive vulnerability risk, possibly associated with the occurrence of depression. There are differences in the cognitive dysfunction for negative stimuli between clinically depressed and sub-clinically depressed individuals. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Selig2006,
abstract = {In this lecture the group of rigid body motions is introduced via its representation on standard three dimensional Euclidian space. The relevance for robotics is that the links of a robot are usually modelled as rigid bodies. Moreover the payload of a robot is also usually a rigid body and hence much of robotics is concerned with understanding rigid transformations and sequences of these transformations. Chasles's theorem is presented, that is: a general rigid body motion is a screw motion, a rotation about a line in space followed by a translation along the line. The lower Reuleaux pairs are introduced. These are essentially surfaces which are invariant under some subgroup of rigid body motions. Such a surface can be the matting surface for a mechanical joint. In this way the basic mechanical joints used in robots can be classified. These surfaces turn out to have other applications in robotics. In robot gripping they are exactly the surfaces that cannot be immobilised using frictionless fingers. In robot vision the symmetries of these surfaces are motions which cannot be detected. Next Lie algebras are introduced. The 1-parameter rigid motions about a joint are considered. The correspondence between elements of the Lie algebra and 1-degree-of-freedom joints is given. The exponential map from the Lie algebra to the group is defined and used to describe the forward kinematics of a serial robot using the product of exponentials formula. The Rodrigues formula for the exponential map is derived using a set of mutually annihilating idempotents. The derivative of the exponential map is explored. In particular the Jacobian matrix for the forward kinematics is derived. More general results are also derived and these are used to show how the inverse kinematics problem can be cast as a set of ordinary differential equations.},

abstract = {Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) exposes the cardiovascular system to intermittent hypoxia, oxidative stress, systemic inflammation, exaggerated negative intrathoracic pressure, sympathetic overactivation, and elevated blood pressure (BP). These can impair myocardial contractility and cause development and progression of heart failure (HF). Epidemiological studies have shown significant independent associations between OSA and HF. On the other hand, recent prospective observational studies reported a significant association between the presence of moderate to severe OSA and increased risk of mortality in patients with HF. In randomized trials, treating OSA with continuous positive airway pressure suppressed sympathetic activity, lowered BP, and improved myocardial systolic function in patients with HF. These data suggest the potential for treatment of OSA to improve clinical outcomes for patients with HF. However, large-scale randomized trials with sufficient statistical power will be needed to ascertain whether treatment of OSA will prevent development of, or reduce morbidity and mortality from HF.},

abstract = {The ability to simultaneously localize a robot and accurately map its surroundings is considered by many to be a key prerequisite of truly autonomous robots. However, few approaches to this problem scale up to handle the very large number of landmarks present in real environments. Kalman filter-based algorithms, for example, require time quadratic in the number of landmarks to incorporate each sensor observation. This paper presents FastSLAM, an algorithm that recursively estimates the full posterior distribution over robot pose and landmark locations, yet scales logarithmically with the number of landmarks in the map. This algorithm is based on a factorization of the posterior into a product of conditional landmark distributions and a distribution over robot paths. The algorithm has been run successfully on as many as 50,000 landmarks, environments far beyond the reach of previous approaches. Experimental results demonstrate the advantages and limitations of the FastSLAM algorithm on both simulated and real-world data.},

A survival of the fittest strategy that selects the points and keyframes of the reconstruction leads to excellent robustness and generates a compact and trackable map that only grows if the scene content changes, allowing lifelong operation.

abstract = {Real-time or online 3D reconstruction has wide applicability and receives further interest due to availability of consumer depth cameras. Typical approaches use a moving sensor to accumulate depth measurements into a single model which is continuously refined. Designing such systems is an intricate balance between reconstruction quality, speed, spatial scale, and scene assumptions. Existing online methods either trade scale to achieve higher quality reconstructions of small objects/scenes. Or handle larger scenes by trading real-time performance and/or quality, or by limiting the bounds of the active reconstruction. Additionally, many systems assume a static scene, and cannot robustly handle scene motion or reconstructions that evolve to reflect scene changes. We address these limitations with a new system for real-time dense reconstruction with equivalent quality to existing online methods, but with support for additional spatial scale and robustness in dynamic scenes. Our system is designed around a simple and flat point-Based representation, which directly works with the input acquired from range/depth sensors, without the overhead of converting between representations. The use of points enables speed and memory efficiency, directly leveraging the standard graphics pipeline for all central operations, i.e., camera pose estimation, data association, outlier removal, fusion of depth maps into a single denoised model, and detection and update of dynamic objects. We conclude with qualitative and quantitative results that highlight robust tracking and high quality reconstructions of a diverse set of scenes at varying scales.},

abstract = {We propose a direct (feature-less) monocular SLAM algorithm which, in contrast to current state-of-the-art regarding direct meth- ods, allows to build large-scale, consistent maps of the environment. Along with highly accurate pose estimation based on direct image alignment, the 3D environment is reconstructed in real-time as pose-graph of keyframes with associated semi-dense depth maps. These are obtained by filtering over a large number of pixelwise small-baseline stereo comparisons. The explicitly scale-drift aware formulation allows the approach to operate on challenging sequences including large variations in scene scale. Major enablers are two key novelties: (1) a novel direct tracking method which operates on sim(3), thereby explicitly detecting scale-drift, and (2) an elegant probabilistic solution to include the effect of noisy depth values into tracking. The resulting direct monocular SLAM system runs in real-time on a CPU.},
